Elastic-AdjointNet : A physics guided deep autoencoder to overcome cross talk effects in multiparameter full waveform inversion
Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is the most popular technique to obtain high resolution estimates of earth model parameters using all information present in seismic. Elastic FWI inverts multicomponent data for P and S-wave velocities and densities. We propose an alternative approach for FWI using a combination of machine learning and the physics of wave propagation. Unlike a conventional supervised machine learning, we do not require known answers to train our network. The multicomponent shot gathers are input to a convolutional neural network (CNNs) based auto encoder whose outputs are used as P-wave, Swave and density models that are used to compute synthetic seismograms using the stress-velocity formulation of the elastic wave equation. The synthetic data are compared against observed input data and the misfit is estimated. The gradient of the misfit with respect to the velocity model parameters is calculated using the adjoint state method. The adjoint state gradient is then used to update the network weights using the automatic differentiation technique. Once the misfit term converges, the neural network can generate subsurface models consistent with the observed data. We observe that the neural network can capture spatial correlations at different scales and thus can introduce regularization in our inverse problem. The regularization is enough to mitigate the cross-talk problem in elastic FWI and also produce good results in areas with low illumination.
