Parametric elastic full waveform inversion with convolutional neural network
Elastic full waveform inversion (EFWI) is a powerful tool for estimating elastic models by reducing the misfit between multi-component seismic records and simulated data. However, when multiple parameters are updated simultaneously, the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters will be coupled together, the effect exacerbate the nonlinear problem. We propose a parametric EFWI method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN-EFWI). The parameters that need to be updated are the weights in the neural network rather than the elastic models. The convolutional kernel in the network can increase spatial correlations of elastic models, which can be regard as a regularization strategy to mitigate local minima issue. Furthermore, the representation also can mitigate the cross-talk between parameters due to the reconstruction of Frechét derivatives by neural networks. Both forward and backward processes are implemented using a time-domain finitedifference solver for elastic wave equation. Numerical examples on overthrust models, fluid saturated models and 2004 BP salt body models demonstrate that CNN-EFWI can partially mitigate the local minima problem and reduce the dependence of inversion on the initial models. Mini-batch configuration is used to speed up the update and achieve fast convergence. In addition, the inversion of noisy data further verifies the robustness of CNN-EFWI.
