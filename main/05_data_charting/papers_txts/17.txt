Seismic Inversion Based on Acoustic Wave
Equations Using Physics-Informed
Neural Network
Yijie Zhang , Xueyu Zhu , and Jinghuai Gao , Member, IEEE

Abstract— Seismic inversion is a significant tool for exploring
the structure and characteristics of the underground. However,
the conventional inversion strategy strongly depends on the initial
model. In this work, we employ the physics-informed neural
network (PINN) to estimate the velocity and density fields based
on acoustic wave equations. In contrast to the traditional purely
data-driven machine learning approaches, PINNs leverage both
available data and the physical laws that govern the observed
data during the training stage. In this work, the first-order
acoustic wave equations are embedded in the loss function as a
regularization term for training the neural networks. In addition
to the limited amount of measurements about the state variables
available at the surface being used as the observational data,
the well logging data is also used as the direct observational
data about the model parameters. The numerical results from
several benchmark problems demonstrate that given noise-free or
noisy data, the proposed inversion strategy is not only capable of
predicting the seismograms, but also estimating the velocity and
density fields accurately. Finally, we remark that although the
absorbing boundary conditions are not imposed in the proposed
method, the reflected waves do not appear from the artificial
boundary in the predicted seismograms.

EISMIC inversion is an important approach to exploring
the underground features of the Earth, particularly for oil
and gas exploration and CO2 sequestration. Full waveform
inversion (FWI) is one of the most effective tools to estimate
the characteristic that includes velocity and density of the
subsurface [1]. The main idea of FWI is to minimize
the discrepancy between the modeled data and observed
data based on specific wave equations. Conventionally, the
observed data are measured at the surface of the Earth by
seismometers. Nonetheless, FWI typically requires a good

initial model, otherwise it is trapped with local minima due to
cycle skipping [2].
With the successful application of machine learning in
many fields [3], there is a growing interest in exploiting
the approximation power of machine learning techniques for
seismic inversion [4], [5]. In [6] and [7], neural networks
are used to establish the relationship between the observed
seismograms and the subsurface structure. Another is to adopt
machine learning as an alternative to replace one of the step in
FWI. For example, the neural network is adopted to represent
the velocity model in FWI, which overcomes the need for an
initial model [8]. Furthermore, the neural network is applied
to extrapolate the missing low frequencies and help mitigate
the cycle skipping problem [9].
For the applications of machine learning in solving the
issues about partial differential equations (PDEs), a popular
research direction is to encode physical laws in the learning framework. Notably, physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) have received a lot of attention in many scientific
fields recently [10], [11]. PINN leverages the governing laws
that the observed data should be satisfied in the learning
framework, which has been shown effective on solving
various problems including elastodynamics [12], high speed
flows [13], fluid mechanics [14]. To increase the performance
of PINN, different strategies have been proposed. Gradientenhanced PINN is proposed to improve the accuracy and
training efficiency [15]. Parallel PINN based on domain
decomposition is studied to further improve the training
efficiency [16]. In order to quantify the uncertainty of the
prediction, Bayesian PINN is proposed to solve both forward
and inverse nonlinear problems [17], [18].
Recently, PINN is also used to tackle the forward and
inverse problems in the context of geophysics. The travel time
based on the eikonal equation is computed by PINN [19],
and the corresponding tomography is also studied [20], [21].
PINN is adopted to solve the Helmholtz equation, which
prevents calculating the inverse of the impedance matrix to
reduce computational cost [22], [23], [24]. PINN-based wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI) method using Helmholtz
equation is developed to invert the velocity field [25]. For
the acoustic wave equations, PINN is applied to simulate
the wavefields in acoustic media, which incorporates the
second-order wave equation in the loss function [26], [27].
Recently, PINN is used to solve the seismic inversion of
the velocity field based on the second-order acoustic wave

equation, where the observation data is collected from the
snapshots [28]. The forward wave propagation and FWIs are
handled simultaneously by PINN, where the two early time
snapshots and the seismograms of the pressure are used as the
observation data. However, only the inversion of the velocity
field was considered [29].
It should be noted that the previous works on PINN-based
FWI is mainly based on the constant-density second-order
acoustic wave equations, which only include pressure and
excludes density. For the inversions based on the coupled
acoustic-elastic model [30], [31], the first-order acoustic wave
equations are frequently employed, because it involves the
velocity and density simultaneously, and the particle velocities
are included in the equations. This is important for the offshore
exploration, as the elastic wave equations could be easily
reduced to the acoustic wave equations by setting the shear
modulus as zero. This motivates to develop PINN for seismic
inversion based on the first-order acoustic wave equations,
where the unknown model parameters include the velocity and
the density. The observational data are collected from the shot
gathers, which are only available at the surface of the model.
The contributions of this work include the following.
1) Instead of considering the snapshot data, we can
consider the measurements of the state variables from
the seismograms observed at the surface. We also
include the well-log data as the observational data about
the model parameters to improve the performance of
inversion, which is available for seismic exploration in
practical applications.
2) We demonstrate that the velocity and density fields
can be estimated simultaneously by PINN, which is
independent of the initial model of the velocity and
density fields. The proposed scheme could potentially
provide a good initial model for FWI.
3) We reveal that although the absorbing boundary
conditions are not imposed in the proposed method,
the reflected waves from the artificial boundary do not
appear in the predicted seismograms.
This article is organized as follows. We describe the firstorder acoustic wave equations and review the basics of PINNs
in Section II. In Section III, several numerical examples
are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
Finally, we conclude in Section IV.

A. Acoustic Wave Equations

underground wave propagation. In this work, we shall focus
on the first-order acoustic wave equations as follows:

source term. The velocity and density c, ρ are the model
parameters that need to be estimated based on available
measurements.
B. Physics-Informed Neural Network for Seismic Inversion
PINN was proposed by Raissi et al. [10] and Lu et al. [32],
which incorporates the physics laws into the loss function
as regularization term and therefore potentially can improve
generalization of the neural network approximation.
1) Structure of Neural Networks: We begin approximating
the state variables u(x, x s , t) = ( p, u, v) by a feed forward
neural networks û(x, x s , t) = N (x, x s , t; θu ), whose input
features include the locations x = (x, z), time t and the source
locations x s . The parameter θu represents the weights and bias
of the neural network. It is worth noting that we consider the
excitation and acquisition at the surface, then the depth of the
source is fixed, only the horizontal axis of the source x s is
presented. The output layer has three neurons representing the
state variables p, u, and v.
To estimate the model parameters, we shall approximate
model parameters λ(x) = (c, ρ) by the same neural network
N (x; θλ ). Here, θλ represents the weights and bias of the
network. Our goal is to estimate the velocity and density fields
in the spatial domain, which is independent of the time and
source location, therefore the input of this neural network is
only related to x.
2) Residual Points and Observed Data: Residual Points: In
order to train the neural networks, the loss function should
be defined. First, we enforce û and λ̂ to satisfy the physical
laws as (1) over a set of selected points, which is referred
as residual points Tr . The residual points could be randomly
chosen from the whole computational domain (x, z, x s , t).
In this work, we can observe seismograms u at the specific
locations, i.e., when the receivers are located at the Earth’s
surface, z = 0. In addition, as the propagating seismic waves
are sparsely distributed in the whole observed data domain

D = (x, 0, x s , t), we adopt the effective sampling strategy
suggested in [33] and [34] to select the residual points:
randomly selecting 80% of the data points from the region
where the seismic waves locate (De = {x ≥ x t ∈ D : x t =
argmax |αu(x, 0, x s , t)|}, α = 0.001) and 20% of the points
from the rest of the domain. Fig. 1 lists the schematic of
the selected residual points. We can observe that the selected
residual points are mainly located in the region with seismic
waves.
Observed Data: In addition, we shall employ the observed
seismograms u as the direct observational data for approximating the surrogate solution û. These observed points are referred
to as data points Td . Due to a large amount of seismograms
data across the sensors, we shall only use partial observations
of the whole seismograms as the observed data, where the
locations of the observed data are also included in residual
points Tr .
Compared with the snapshot-based training strategy [28],
the seismograms are much less informative. Therefore,
we consider leveraging well-logging data in the training stage.
Well logging is the practice of making a detailed record
from a well log of the geologic formations penetrated by a
borehole [35], which can provide direct observations of the
model parameters, including velocity and density λ = (c, ρ)

at specific locations. We refer those data points as well logging
data points Tw .
3) Loss Function: With the above-mentioned notations,
we define the loss function as the weighted summation of the
L 2 norm of residuals for the PDE and data misfit as follows:
L(θ ; T ) = ωr Lr (θ ; Tr ) + ωd Ld (θ ; Td ) + ωw Lw (θ ; Tw ) (2)
where T = {Tr , Td , Tw } and

in [36] and [37]. The first term in (3) acts as the regularization
mechanism that penalizes solutions and estimated parameters
that do not satisfy the wave equations. We remark that this
term in PINN is an unsupervised loss, which is independent

variables and model parameters, respectively. Specifically,
we adopt the fully connected neural network, whose structure
is listed in Table I. In order to handle the observed
seismograms efficiently, we encode the source location as the
input of the neural network N (x, x s , t; θu ). With well-defined
neural networks, the PDE loss, could be obtained by automatic
differentiation to constrain the outputs of the neural network
to satisfy the physical laws. In addition to the observed data,
we can minimize the total loss function as (2) to search the
optimal parameters θu , θλ .
5) Physics-Based Data Normalization: In the practical
applications, the magnitude of the pressure p is O(107 ) larger
than those of particle velocities (u, v) in (1) due to the
international unit system. Therefore, it is challenging to train
the neural network due to different scales of the state variables
and the corresponding equation residuals. Here, we use the
dimension transformation to mitigate the issue.
First, to keep the orders of magnitude for velocity c and
density ρ as O(100 ), we change the unit of length and weight
10−3

10−12

as length : km −−→ m, weight : 1012 kg −−→ kg. Then the
10−3

units of velocity c and density ρ become c : km/s −−→ m/s,

located at a depth of 10 m and xs is in the range 10 to 810 m equally with a
spacing of 200 m. The 34 receivers are located at the same depth and placed

randomly from the whole computational domain.
4) Training: With the well-defined loss function as (2),
the proper parameters θu and θλ for the neural network
N (x, x s , t; θu ) and N (x; θλ ) can be searched via minimizing
the following optimization problem by ADAM [38]:
{θu , θλ } := argmin L(θ ; T ).

Overall, the workflow of PINN for seismic inversion based
on the acoustic wave equations is shown in Fig. 2. Two
independent neural networks are selected to represent the state

ρ : 1012 kg/km3 −−→ kg/m3 . It is worth noting that
1012 kg/km3 = 1 g/cm3 actually. Correspondingly, the units
of pressure p and particle velocities (u, v) are changed to
10−9

p : 1012 kg/km · s2 −−→ kg/m · s2
10−3

(u, v) : km/s −−→ m/s.

With the transformation of units, the magnitude of the pressure
p is O(101 ) bigger than those of particle velocities (u, v),
instead of O(107 ).
We remark that in contrast with the commonly used
normalization strategy, such as normalization by mean or
the maximum value of the state variable, the proposed one
maintains the physical relationships of the parameters and state
variables in the acoustic wave equations, which is important
for PINNs.
III. R ESULTS
For seismic inversion, the observed seismic data are always
sparse, where the receivers and sources are only located at the
specific positions, i.e., the surface of the Earth or the borehole.

To generate the seismogram for the next three examples,
we use the finite difference method [39] with grid spacing

is represented by a Ricker wavelet, which can be expressed as

section, we shall test the feasibility and performance of the
PINNs for seismic inversion based on the first-order acoustic
wave equations in the two-layered, complex three-layered, and
salt body media.

In addition, we employ the perfect matched layer (PML)

waves from the artificial boundary. The seismograms are
generated by five different sources, where their depth
(z-direction) is 10 m and x s ranges from 10 to 810 m equally
with a spacing of 200 m in x-direction.

are randomly generated on purpose to demonstrate that the
proposed inversion strategy is independent of the initial model.
We evaluate our approach on an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU
with a memory of 11 GB.
We remark that it is well known that the solution of a
wave equation can be represented by the superposition of
plane simple harmonic waves [41]. In addition, a previous
study suggested that the sine activation functions are beneficial
due to the moment-preserving properties of intermediate
layers [42]. Therefore, the activation functions in the neural
network N (x, x s , t; θu ) that approximates the state variables
p, u and v are chosen as sin(x).

Two separated neural networks are used to approximate the
model parameters (c, ρ) and the state variables ( p, u, and
v), respectively. The corresponding hidden layers, neurons
per layer, and the activation function for different examples
are shown in Table I. The learning rate, the batch size,
the number of epochs and the number of residual and data
points are also listed in Table I. The learning rate decays
exponentially from 0.001 to 0.00001 in order to ensure
convergence. The number of residual points increases with the
increase in the complexity of the model structure. The width
and depth of the neural networks are chosen based on the best
performance on a validation set. It is worth to be noted that
the initialization of the neural networks used in the examples

First, we examine the performance of the PINN with a
simple two-layered model, which is shown in Fig. 3(a). The
two well logs at x = 0.3 and 0.6 km are used to measure
the velocity c and density ρ. 200 well-logging data points are
used as the observation data for the velocity and density fields,
respectively.
The estimated velocity and density field by PINN based on
noise-free measurements is shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be seen
that the profiles of predicted model parameters match well
with the ground truth ones. Besides, we further compare the
predicted and ground truth velocities at x = 0.5 km, shown in
Fig. 4(a), in which the predicted velocity is in good agreement
with the ground truth.
In Fig. 5, we further plot the ground truth and predicted
seismograms as well as their corresponding differential profiles
when the source is located at x s = 410 m. It is worth noting
that the data points are collected from 34 receivers that are
located at the depth of 10 m and placed from 10 to 1000 m
equally with a spacing of 30 m. We can observe that the
seismograms predicted by PINN are accurate, where the direct
and the reflected waves from the interface are well captured.
In addition, from the differential profiles of p, u, and v,
we observe that the error of the reconstructed seismograms is
relatively small. It is worth noting that although the absorbing
boundary conditions are not imposed in PINNs, the artificial
reflection is hardly observed from the predicted seismograms.
To further demonstrate the performance of PINNs, we also
plot the time history of the predicted and the ground truth

seismograms at x = 0.6 km in Fig. 6(a), where the forward
solution by PINN also matches well with the ground truth.
In order to test the performance of the proposed method to
deal with the noisy measurements, we corrupt the observed

seismograms by the Gaussian noise with the level of 10%.
In addition, we remark that the observed velocity and
density from the well-logging data are assumed to be noisefree, thanks to the accurate measurement process [35]. The
corresponding predicted velocity and density are shown in
Fig. 3(c), where the predicted model parameters are relatively
robust to the noise included in the observed seismograms.
We further compare the predicted velocity at x = 0.5 km in
Fig. 4(b), where the predicted velocity of the first layer differs
marginally with the ground truth one. We also compare the
seismograms as shown in Fig. 6(b). Notably, the predicted
seismogram by PINN indicates that the neural network tends
to filter out the noises and deliver smooth results. We point
out that the ground truth represents the observed seismogram
with 10% noise.

two deeper layers [28] as shown in Fig. 7(a). The well logs at
x = 0.05, 0.18, 0.4, 0.61, 0.8, 0.99 km are used to measure
the velocity and density.
The predicted velocity and density fields are shown in
Fig. 7(b). We can observe that the major features of the model
could be captured, especially the locations of two inflection
points are well predicted. We also compare the predicted
and ground truth velocities in Fig. 8(a), where the predicted
velocity by PINNs agrees well with the ground truth one.
In addition, when the observed seismograms are corrupted by
the Gaussian noise with the level of 10%, the corresponding
result is shown in Figs. 7(c) and 8(b). It is clear that the

inversion by PINNs is less sensitive with the measurements
with mild level noises.
When the source is located at x s = 410 m, the ground truth
and predicted seismograms, and the corresponding differential
profiles are shown in Fig. 9. We can observe that the direct
and reflected waves from the first interfaces are captured
clearly from the predicted seismograms by PINN, even the
reflected waves from the slope are also accurately predicted
in u (see the reflected waves around t = 0.5, 0.7 s for
example). The differential profiles demonstrate the errors of
the predicted results are relatively small, i.e., the errors of
p, u, and v are about 10%, which demonstrates the PINN
handles the forward problems effectively. Notably, while the
absorbing boundary conditions are not formally incorporated
in the proposed method, the artificial reflections from the
boundaries do not appear in the predicted results by PINN.
In addition, the comparison between the predicted and
the ground truth seismograms of the state variable p at
x = 0.6 km is shown in Fig. 10. For the noise-free case,
we observe that the predicted direct and reflected waves match
well with the ground truth ones, even for the reflected wave
with a small amplitude. Moreover, the noisy case is also
shown here, which demonstrates that the suggested approach
could effectively mitigate the effect caused by mild noise on
predicted seismograms.
C. Salt Body Media
The geometry of the complex model is typical for a
part from the North Sea [43]. The model includes seven
different layers, and the velocity increases with depth from
2.0 to 5.0 km/s, the range of the density is from
1.4 to 3.0 g/cm3 . In each region, the velocity and density are
assumed to be constant. The inclusion in Fig. 11(a) is a salt
diapir with a high velocity of 4.3 km/s. The inversion of the
salt body is quite challenging as insufficient illumination for
the subsalt sediments [44]. In this section, we shall examine
the performance of the PINN for the inversion of the salt body
model. The well logs at x = 0.02, 0.15, 0.26, 0.32, 0.37, 0.42,
0.45, 0.65, and 0.92 km are used to measure the velocity and
density.
The predicted velocity and density fields by PINN is shown
in Fig. 11(b), where the shape of the salt body is clearly

captured by PINN. In addition, we compare the predicted and
the ground truth velocities in Fig. 12(a). The key features of
the velocity fields are predicted accurately by PINNs even
for discontinuities. When the observation data are collected

from the seismograms with 10% Gaussian noise, the results
in Figs. 11(c) and 12(b) demonstrate that the main trend
of predicted velocity is consistent with the ground truth
one. Nonetheless, the predictions at several locations are less
accurate, i.e., the depth is 0.25 and 0.8 km as shown in
Fig. 12(b) and the artifacts at depth of 0.8 km in Fig. 11(c),
which indicates that the inversion problems for the complex
model based on the noisy data are challenging.
Fig. 13 presents the ground truth, predicted seismograms,
and their differential profiles when the source is located at
x s = 410 m. It is clear that the main direct waves and
reflected waves are well reconstructed by PINN. The relatively
small errors as in the differential profiles demonstrate that
the proposed method works well in the forward problems.
As shown in Fig. 13(b), the reflected waves from the artificial
boundary do not appear in the predicted results by PINN,
highlighting the capability of handling the scenario of wave
propagation in an infinite domain.
We also compare the time history from the predicted and
the ground truth seismograms as shown in Fig. 14. The direct

wave and reflected wave from the first layer are well captured
by PINNs. For the noise-free case, the reflected waves from
the deeper interfaces capture well with the ground truth
ones. When the observed seismograms are corrupted by 10%
noise, the predicted results and the noiseless ground truth
seismogram also agree well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed framework is capable to tackle the seismic inversion
for the complex model.
IV. C ONCLUSION
We developed a seismic inversion strategy based on PINN
in which the first-order acoustic wave equations are encoded
into the loss function as a regularization term. Besides the
partially observed seismograms at the surface, we also include
the well-logging data as the observation data about the
model parameters. The numerical results demonstrated that the
velocity and density fields could be accurately estimated by
PINN without requiring a good initial model as the standard
FWI does. In addition, we remarked that the reflected waves
from the artificial boundaries can be avoided without the
enforcement of the absorbing boundary conditions in our
method. Therefore, the suggested method not only provides a
novel tool for seismic inversion, but also it potentially provides
a decent initial model about velocity and density for standard
FWI approaches, if the better inversion results are needed.
