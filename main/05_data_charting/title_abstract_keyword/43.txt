Deep learning-based groundwater storage estimation from seismic data
In this work, an inverse problem of estimating the water table level and actual stored water in an aquifer from seismic data is studied. Both the elastic and poroviscoelastic wave equations are used to model wave propagation in the ground. The equations are spatially discretized using a nodal discontinuous Galerkin method, while temporally using the explicit low-storage Runge-Kutta method. The actual inverse problem is solved using a deep learning approach based the convolutional neural networks. Our simulation results suggest that the neural network-based method can be used to accurately estimate the water table level and stored water from noisy data.
