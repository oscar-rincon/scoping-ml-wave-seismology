ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Preserving low-frequency components in seismic data is challenging due to data acquisition
restrictions and the processing of low-cut filtering after surveys. If seismic data lack low frequencies, their resolution deteriorates, leading to inaccurate seismic interpretations. To resolve this
problem, we developed a low-frequency reconstruction that employs a modified U-Net neural
network. To improve the training of the neural network, we generated training data analogous to
unseen data, based on the far-field signature as the wavelet source to retain the spectral characteristics of field data. We addressed potential overfitting by generating a large amount of various
synthetic data through wave equation-based modelling using a variety of velocity and density
models. After synthesising the seismic data, we implemented a filtering method to produce input
data with insufficient low frequencies and label data with sufficient low frequencies. The far-field
signature plays an important role in the successful reconstruction of low frequencies due to its
intrinsic field data features and greater low-frequency information compared to field data alone.
We tested the generalisation of the network using unseen synthetic and field data not used in the
training stage, and analyzed the results in the time and frequency domains. Although the input
data did not retain frequencies below 10 Hz, the trained network predicted low frequencies that
were similar to the desired data. We also produced post-stack sections via simple processing to
evaluate low-frequency reconstructions produced by our trained network. The low-frequency
reconstruction scheme led to a better understanding of subsurface media.

Introduction
In seismic exploration, the acquisition of sufficient lowfrequency components has attracted great interest,
because they provide robust full waveform inversion
(FWI) and broadband seismic data with enhanced resolution (Ten Kroode et al. 2013). However, it is difficult to acquire sufficient offshore low-frequency seismic data due to the limitations of standard acquisition systems and low-cut filtering for noise removal
(Fang et al. 2020). However, recent developments in
seismic acquisition systems have facilitated the recording of ultra-low-frequency components and acquisition of broadband seismic data. Using ocean bottom
nodes (OBNs) and low-frequency seismic sources, lowfrequency data can now be obtained (Brenders et al.
2022). However, because research groups frequently
exploit conventional seismic acquisition systems consisting of narrow-azimuth towed streamers and air
gun arrays, low-frequency acquisition remains challenging. In offshore seismic exploration, towed streamer
systems record important geological signals that are
often accompanied by noise (e.g. swell noise) in the
low-frequency band. To remove this noise, low-cut filtering is typically performed in the early stages of

seismic data processing, which creates an unavoidable
shortage of low frequencies. This lack of low frequencies
exacerbates reverberation, which in turn distorts signals
and degrades overall resolution. Together, these phenomena complicate the accurate geological interpretation of subsurface structures. Optimised problem-based
advanced imaging techniques such as FWI may not provide reliable solutions when the problem falls into local
minima.
Prior to the advent of machine learning (ML), a variety of studies sought to improve the accuracy of lowfrequency predictions. For example, Hu (2014) introduced beat-tone inversion, which extracts low frequencies from two different seismic wavefields. Wu, Luo,
and Wu (2014) and Hu et al. (2017) reconstructed
low frequencies using an envelope of signals. Li and
Demanet (2016) extracted low-frequency components
from higher frequencies using a phase-tracking method
suggested by Li and Demanet (2015). Later studies successfully predicted lower frequencies using broadband
sources (Wang and Herrmann 2016; Zhang et al. 2017).
However, these studies had a limited ability to
reconstruct realistic low-frequency components (Sun
and Demanet 2020). Notably, it was difficult to make

connections between low and high frequencies and
to accurately report the behaviours of adjacent traces
in space (Ovcharenko et al. 2019). To address these
problems, several novel ML-based approaches have
been developed. In the early stages of ML-based seismic research, Ovcharenko et al. (2019) applied ML to
low-frequency extensions, synthesising common shot
gathers using random velocity models and then producing training datasets using Fourier transform models. They extended the frequency bandwidth up to
0.25 Hz using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
and applied the predicted low frequencies to FWI.
Unlike Ovcharenko et al. (2019), who adopted training datasets in the frequency-space domain, Sun and
Demanet (2020) selected time–space domain seismic
data as training datasets, and the frequencies of the
input and label data were 5–20 and 0.1–5 Hz, respectively, such that the frequency bandwidths of the training datasets did not overlap. They demonstrated the
accuracy of their trained network by performing FWI
using the Marmousi and BP 2004 benchmark models.
Fang et al. (2020) also used time–space domain seismic
data for low-frequency extrapolation. However, unlike
Sun and Demanet (2020), the frequency bandwidths
of their training data overlapped: the input and label
patches had cut-off frequencies of 10 and 6 Hz, respectively. Their study was the first attempt to apply an MLbased low-frequency extension to unseen field data and
showed remarkable performance in predicting low frequencies in field data and presenting reliable results for
multi-scale FWI and least-squares reverse-time migration (Fang et al. 2020). With few exceptions, other early
studies confined their test datasets to synthetic seismic
data, because when the training data consists of synthesised wavefields, the trained networks are unable
to explain actual physical phenomena or real-world
complexities, resulting in poor generalisation (Aharchaou and Baumstein 2020). To resolve this problem
and relay actual physics to ML, Aharchaou and Baumstein (2020) conducted an ML-based study using field
data acquired from OBNs. The training datasets were
created from OBN data and the trained network was
verified using streamer data. However, unlike seismic
surveys that use only streamers, OBN surveys require
a large budget, which makes them feasible only for a
few research groups. Thus, it may be difficult to prepare
training datasets mirroring real-world characteristics for
the majority of generalised cases.
In this study, we developed a practical method
for streamer surveys, utilising the far-field signature
to reflect the characteristics of unseen data to training data. We used a wave equation-based modelling
scheme to synthesise training datasets that were
applied to train a modified U-Net-based neural network (Wang, Xu, and Zhou 2020). Then, we validated
the trained network using field data and unseen data.
We provide detailed explanations of the generation of

training datasets for successful ML, along with brief
explanations of the velocity and density models used
to synthesise seismic data. We also introduce the usage
of the far-field signature, as the most important contribution to data generation proposed in this study. Further, we explain the wave equation modelling scheme
and its two-dimensional (2D) time-domain, cell-based,
finite-difference method (FDM) for the generation of
training data, as well as the filtering method used to
divide the training data into input and label data. We
introduce the modified U-Net and its hyperparameters
and explain the training results. Finally, we provide synthetic testing and generalisation results, which were
used to verify the proposed ML method. In addition to
time–space domain seismic data, we also used spectral
data to evaluate the low-frequency extension. Through
comparisons of post-stack sections with simple seismic
processing, we verified that low-frequency components
were properly constructed by the trained network.

Method
Training data generation
Velocities, densities, and source wavelets were needed
to synthesise seismic data for use in training datasets.
To account for diversity, it was necessary to generate a large number of velocity models with various
distributions and without redundancy, in addition to
corresponding density models that were geologically
dependent on these velocities. To take the characteristics of the testing data (i.e. field data) into consideration during training data generation, it was necessary
to determine several parameters associated with sea
bottom depth, layer thickness, and subsurface structure. The source wavelets also required careful selection because they play a critical role in ensuring that
the training data accurately reflect the characteristics
of field data. The acquisition of correct source estimation from the obtained field data will contribute to the
generation of practical training datasets. Rather than
relying on laborious source estimation, we took advantage of the far-field signature that was simultaneously
recorded during the acquisition of seismic data from
the North Viking Graben in the North Sea (Keys and
Foster 1998). The far-field signature is suitable for producing realistic training datasets because it is acquired
using identical equipment (i.e. air gun arrays) under the
same environmental conditions in which the field data
were recorded, and contains lower frequency components than the field data. Once the physical parameters (i.e. velocities, densities, and far-field signature)
were resolved, we solved the wave equation numerically to generate synthetic data and produced a large
number of input data without low frequencies, and
label data with low frequencies, through band-pass
filtering.

EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICS

Velocity and density models
To avoid bias in the training datasets, it was necessary to create a large number of numerical models
with various stratigraphic interfaces and velocity distributions without redundancy. We created numerical
2D velocity models with simple stratigraphy and folds
by partly following the method of Wu et al. (2020),
which suggested the construction of three-dimensional
(3D) velocity models (Choi and Pyun 2021). Thus, 1,000
different velocities were required to create the 1,000
unique common shot gathers that were used as training
data in this study (Figure 1).
We also needed as many density models as velocity models. The Mobil AVO datasets provide well data
(measured P-wave, S-wave, and density logs) as well as
surface seismic data (Hanitzsch et al. 1998). However,
it was beyond the scope of this study to calibrate density and/or establish the relationship between density
and velocity using limited data. Therefore, we elected to
produce plausible training datasets with trivial effort. To
create density models, we adopted Gardner’s equation

265

(Gardner, Gardner, and Gregory 1974) to define empirical relationships between density and velocity, and set
the density of water at 1 g/cm3 .

Far-field signature
The amplitude spectrum of the far-field signature
indicated that it contains low-frequency components
(Figure 2(a)). Because we produced synthetic data by
solving the wave equation numerically, high-frequency
components were not useful for the data generation stage. Indeed, high frequencies created dispersion errors during wave equation modelling, such that
high-cut filtering was needed to generate a source signature with low-frequency components. Considering
the dispersion analysis of our numerical modelling, we
selected a cut-off frequency of 30 Hz for the source
wavelet (Figure 2(c)). To address any concerns about
the potential loss of good data through the removal of
high-frequency components, we focused on a limited
bandwidth to improve the efficiency of training data

2020; Choi and Pyun 2021).

generation and then recalled the data after predicting
low frequencies using ML. Our efforts to avoid data loss
are described comprehensively below.

Wave equation-based modelling with 2D
time-domain, cell-based FDM
To generate the training datasets, we applied the following 2D time–space domain acoustic wave equation:

where K is the bulk modulus consisting of density and
P-wave velocity, and u, f , and ρ denote the pressure
wavefield, source signature, and density, respectively.
To solve the wave equation numerically, we adopted
cell-based FDM (Min, Shin, and Yoo 2004; Lee, Min et al.
2008; Lee, Lim et al. 2009), which assigns physical properties in the cells and wavefields to their respective
points (Figure 3).
When solving the wave equation using the conventional FDM for media with a heterogeneous density
model, it is usually necessary to differentiate densities
directly on interfaces where they vary. However, cellbased FDM has the advantage of direct differentiation
of densities because the properties are stored within the
cells (Park and Ha 2019). Therefore, based on the cellbased FDM, Equation (1) can be expressed as follows:

Filtering for training datasets
We implemented low-cut filtering, which erases frequencies below 10 Hz to generate input data lacking low-frequency components. To avoid the Gibbs
phenomenon, which distorts accurate interpretations,
tapering was applied from 10 to 25 Hz (Figure 4(a)).
Unlike the input data, the label data do not require lowcut filtering because they should have sufficient low frequencies (Figure 4(b)). Thus, 800 training datasets and
200 validation datasets were generated.

Modified U-Net
We chose to use a modified architecture of the original U-Net (Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox 2015) that
was suggested by Wang, Xu, and Zhou (2020). Compared to the original network, the modified U-Net has
one fewer layer and nearly half the channel size. The
dimension and shape of our input images differed from
those generally used in ML, with 120 traces in the horizontal direction and 1,000 time samples in the vertical direction. A deeper network indicates stronger constraints, which makes the modified U-Net a more suitable option for our rectangular-shaped training images
(Figure 5). As explained above, time–space domain synthetic data (Figure 4) were assigned to input and label
data. Unlike label data, input data rarely have frequencies below 10 Hz. Therefore, to preserve the relative
amplitude characteristics, we used whole shot gathers
rather than patches, and selected the hyperparameters
listed in Table 1.
Training and validation loss curves during 30 epochs
are shown in Figure 6. The loss function was based on
the root mean square error (RMSE; Table 1). The RMSE
of both the training and validation datasets decreased
during the training stage until 30 epochs. Unlike the
training error, the validation error did not decrease dramatically and almost converged at 30 epochs, indicating that the network was well trained within 30 epochs.

method (FDM). Physical properties including density (ρ) and
velocity (v) are assigned to cells, and waveﬁelds (u) are calculated at grid points.

After the network is trained, the trained model must be
validated using unseen data that were not used during training. For the synthetic test, we used a small
portion of the Marmousi-2 velocity and density data
(Martin, Larsen, and Marfurt 2002), as shown in Figure
7. The numerical models have complex geological features including huge fold structures, normal faults, and
unconformities.

Because the low-frequency extension is highly
dependent on characteristics of the source wavelet,
we used the high-cut-filtered far-field signature (Figure

2(c)) as the source wavelet. An unseen seismogram
was modelled using the 2D time–space domain acoustic wave equation and cell-based FDM. The input seismogram was generated using the same bandpass filtering method used for the training data. The input
data for the synthetic test is shown in Figure 8(a),
and the predictions obtained using the trained model
are presented in Figure 8(b). Compared to the desired
data shown in Figure 8(c), the overall resolution and
continuities were improved and waveforms became
discernible. Figure 8(d) shows discrepancies between
the desired and predicted data. These differences are

some frequencies below 15 Hz were also estimated.
There were inconsistencies in low-frequency extensions
when there was little low-frequency information in the
input data; however, the predicted data were generally
similar to the desired data.
To quantitatively assess the results, we calculated
the mean square error (MSE), RMSE, and mean absolute

primarily interpreted as ultra-low-frequency components of the events, which arose because actual ultralow frequencies are extremely difficult to reconstruct.
This phenomenon is also evident in the amplitude spectra shown in Figure 9, which represents the amplitude
spectra of Figure 8(a) without ultra-low frequencies.
Figure 9(b) shows the amplitude spectra of Figure 8(b)
with the low frequencies reconstructed and bandwidth
extended. Figure 9(c) shows the amplitude spectra of
the desired data (i.e. Figure 8(c)), and Figure 9(d) shows
the differences between the predicted and desired
amplitude spectra. As shown in Figure 9(d), the accuracy of the ultra-low frequency extension was limited;
however, frequencies in the range of 15–23 Hz were
predicted without critical errors, and some frequencies
below 15 Hz were also well estimated.
For inspection and comparison of the data, we calculated mean values for all traces (Figure 10). Amplitudes

where n is the number of pixels in the seismogram
(excluding negligible amplitudes); i is the index of the
pixel, such that ŷi indicates the ith amplitude of the
desired seismogram, and yi indicates the ith amplitude
of input or predicted seismogram. Table 2 shows the
MSE, RMSE, and MAE values for the synthetic test. Significant errors were caused by differences between the
input data and the desired data, whereas only minor
errors occurred when the predicted data were similar to
the desired data.

Generalisation test
The field data used in the generalisation test were 2D
seismic data obtained from the North Viking Graben
in the North Sea (Keys and Foster 1998; Madiba and
McMechan 2003). These data were released by ExxonMobil and included 25 line km seismic data that were
used to compare seismic inversion schemes at the 1994
Society of Exploration Geophysicists workshop (Figure

11). We used approximately 4 s of data from the original
6 s recording.
Figure 12 shows a variety of spectra compared to the
nearest trace shown in Figure 11. The original spectrum
(black line) shows that the field data contain both highand low-frequency components. To ensure the generalizability of our low-frequency reconstruction method
using ML, we intentionally adopted both low-cut and

high-cut filtering (30 Hz maximum frequency) for our
training data. As previously explained, the field data had
somewhat low frequencies; therefore, it was also possible to arrange the desired output data using the original
as a reference.
We generated a total of 1,001 input data containing frequencies from 10 to 30 Hz (Figure 13(a)). Figure
13(b) shows the predicted results obtained using the

trained network. Figure 13(c) shows the desired output,
including spectral characteristics that were illustrated as
the orange dotted line in Figure 12. Figure 13(a) lacks
very low frequencies, which made strong ringing artifacts more apparent. By contrast, Figure 13(b), whose
low frequencies were reconstructed by ML, represents
a better shot gather, with reduced ringing artifacts
and increased dominance of important waveform signals that are discriminable in both near traces and faroffset traces. To evaluate the accuracy of the predicted

results, we compared these data with the desired output, which included actual low-frequency components
(Figure 13(c)) by plotting their differences (Figure 13(d)).
The predicted result was not identically reconstructed;
there were limitations in the ultra-low frequency extensions. However, a comparison with the input data
showed that the predicted results were still noteworthy.
The overall magnitude of amplitude on the predicted
seismogram was slightly lower than that of the original
data because the amplitude of the ultra-low frequencies

was less well reconstructed. Despite the problem, the
predicted signals were significantly improved compared to the input data. For a different perspective,
we observed the results in terms of amplitude spectra
(Figure 14). Although the input data seldom contained
frequencies below 20 Hz (Figure 14(a)) due to low-cut filtering, they showed significant recovery (Figure 14(b)).

14(d), frequencies from 15 to 20 Hz on ML-predicted
traces were accurately recovered. Although estimated
frequencies below 15 Hz are rarely guaranteed, the
trends of the spectra in the frequency–space domain
approximated the desired result.
For more detailed inspection, we extracted the input,
desired, and predicted spectra from the traces and calculated their mean values (Figure 15). The predicted
data showed frequencies similar to those of the input
data, with no large distortions above 25 Hz and wellrecovered frequencies below 25 Hz. Actual frequencies
can be well estimated if they are present in the input
data; otherwise, frequency recovery becomes almost
impossible. The trained network also predicted ultralow frequencies below 5 Hz; however, it was difficult
to assure their accuracy because the far-field signature,
which was used to generate label data, did not have sufficient frequency information below 5 Hz. Thus, our ML
method resulted in a fairly reasonable frequency spectrum despite poor low frequencies in the input data.

Next, we evaluated the performance of the network
in terms of generalisation; the resulting MSE, RMSE, and

satisfactorily because the features of the field data are
much more complex.

To determine the impact of the extended low frequencies on seismic interpretations, we performed conventional seismic processing. First, we restored the high
frequencies, which were previously excluded, to their
correct input, desired, and predicted data points. After
this method was performed for all 1,001 shot gathers,
the spectral band became broader. Unlike seismic processing typically conducted in industrial, commercial,

or in-depth research, the conventional seismic processing that we performed consisted of a few simple
tasks: direct wave muting, velocity analysis, surfacerelated multiple elimination, normal moveout correction, and FX migration. To confirm the accuracy of our
ML results and the versatility of our network, these processing methods were applied identically to the input,
desired, and predicted data and the three resulting

post-stack sections were compared (Figure 16). In the
first post-stack section, derived from input data without low frequencies, the overall amplitudes or events
were weak and geological structures were too ambiguous for accurate interpretation (Figure 16(a)). This problem was caused by ringing effects in the shot gathers
that were reflected in the stack section. Compared to
the input data, the second section, derived from the
predicted data, showed better continuity between geological structures, with considerably less ringing (Figure
16(b)). Thus, the low frequencies predicted using our ML
method contributed to significant improvement in geological interpretation compared to the desired section
(Figure 16(c)).
As a more detailed inspection, we extracted traces
from each section to a horizontal distance of 1.5 km and
compared the results (Figure 17). The input data lacked
low frequencies, whereas the desired data contained
sufficient low frequencies. Although the ML-predicted
data did not perfectly reproduce the original data, their
trend converged with the desired data and discrepancies between the input and predicted data were more
conspicuous than those between the predicted and
desired data. Thus, our proposed ML method accurately predicted low-frequency components, providing
opportunities for better interpretation and understanding of subsurface media that will improve the resolution
of seismic data and enhance the continuity of reflection
events.

Conclusions
This study generated training datasets that enabled
successful ML-based low-frequency extensions using
wave equation-based modelling, a variant of subsurface modelling (i.e. velocity and density), and a far-field
signature containing shot excitation characteristics during the acquisition phase. The far-field signature played
an essential role in mitigating the chronic problem of
low-frequency data shortages and improved the resolution of unseen data. The far-field signature can be

obtained simultaneously with seismic data using the
same streamer system, depending on the acquisition
conditions. It provides more detailed low-frequency
data compared to multi-channel seismic data, and
therefore creates more satisfactory training data for
low-frequency extensions. However, it may be impossible to obtain a far-field signature with field data due
to suboptimal conditions (e.g. shallow water depth). In
such cases, it may be worthwhile to obtain the nearfield signature rather than the far-field signature for
the generation of proper training data. The near-field
signature also offers the opportunity to gather source
and low-frequency components, and does not produce ghost reflections, unlike the far-field signature.
Thus, reasonable training data may still be obtained
using the near-field signature. Instead of a source array
system with multiple sources, particularly if a single
source is shot, the near-field signature can be used
as a source wavelet for numerical modelling; next,
ML-based low-frequency extension and generalisation
would be required to validate the approach, and the
resulting data should be compared to far-field applications. These steps would allow future studies to verify the robustness of ML-based low-frequency extensions against ghosting effects when using the far-field
signature.
