Underground hydrogen storage leakage detection and characterization based on machine learning of sparse seismic data
Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is considered as a scalable approach for massive storage and seasonal extraction of hydrogen (H2). Although conventional leakage detection and characterization methods based on time-lapse seismic imaging and inversion generally apply to H2 leakage detection problem, a high-fidelity yet cost effective geophysics approach is still missing to reliably inform leakage location and properties based on very sparse data. In response, we develop a novel supervised machine learning method to detect and characterize H2 leakage from UHS. The input to our neural network are sparse time-lapse seismic waveforms, while the output from the neural network includes the spatial location and physical properties of a H2 leakage. We generate high-quality time-lapse waveforms using the elastic-wave equations to train the neural network. We train and validate our machine learning model and find that it attains high accuracy in using extremely sparse time-lapse seismic data to detect and characterize H2 leakage. Our investigation is the first systematic study that focuses on applying machine learning to subsurface H2 leakage detection and characterization and could potentially serve as a cost-effective geophysical tool for underground hydrogen leakage detection and characterization with high fidelity.
