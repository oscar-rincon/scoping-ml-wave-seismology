The absence of shear-wave (S-wave) velocity in well log data limits the effective seismic characterization of li­
thology, petrophysical properties, and fluid distribution of tight reservoirs in the Chang 7 shale oil formations of
Ordos Basin, west China. However, conventional rock physics models (RPMs), e.g., the Xu-White model, struggle
to accurately obtain the key parameters such as pore aspect ratio in the process of S-wave velocity prediction.
This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and
RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave
propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical
properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave
velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorpo­
rating the decoupled Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the
modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex
pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are
considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the
final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is
sufficient. In particular, provided a small amount of measured S-wave data (even ten data points), the trained
DNN model can also provide reasonable predictions.

1. Introduction
The shear wave (S-wave) velocity, in addition to the compressional
wave (P-wave) velocity and bulk density, plays an important role as the
geophysical well log data in practical applications such as pre-stack
seismic inversion, reservoir-property prediction, and fluid identifica­
tion (Downton, 2005; Ba et al., 2011; Rabbani et al., 2017; Oloruntobi
et al., 2019; Pang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022; Qing
et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2023). Particularly, S-wave velocity of log data is
essential when a pre-stack seismic inversion is performed to extract
elastic parameters (Vernik et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2021). However, due
to the actual technical and economical concerns, S-wave logging data is
usually absent (Tan et al., 2015; Mehrgini et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2020). Therefore, it is quite meaningful to develop the prediction

methods of S-wave velocity for petroleum reservoirs.
In absence of S-wave velocity logging data, a great number of studies
have been performed on the methods for S-wave velocity prediction.
These conventional methods can be classified into two categories:
empirical formula-based estimation and rock physics model (RPM)based prediction. The empirical formula-based method is a rapid and
straightforward approach which is commonly employed for estimating
S-wave velocity. It involves conducting a statistical analysis of both Pand S-wave velocities, to achieve the derivation of empirical relations
between P- and S-wave velocities through a fitting process (Pickett,
1963; Castagna et al., 1985). Han et al. (1986), Castagna et al. (1985),
and Eskandari et al. (2004) showed that based on a great number of
experimental studies, a quasi-linear or nonlinear empirical relationship
between P- and S-wave velocities can be derived for reservoir rocks.

physics-informed ML for overpressure prediction by embedding a
frequency-dependent quality factor (Q)-pressure petrophysical model
(Guo and Fu, 2007) into the activation function of convolution neurons.
In particular, various ML technologies have been applied for pre­
dicting S-wave velocity logging data, such as support vector regression
(SVR) (Brereton and Lloyd, 2010; Ni et al., 2017), long-short-term
memory (LSTM) (Mehrgini et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang
et al., 2020b), gated recurrent units (GRUs) (Sun and Liu, 2020; Arun­
Kumar et al., 2021), and gradient boosting (Guelman, 2012; Bentéjac
et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2021), etc. By constructing a neural network
(NN), it is possible to establish a multivariate function that relates
S-wave velocity to petrophysical properties. However, the NN-based
approach for S-wave velocity prediction suffers from inadequate
generalization and a scarcity of labeled data to construct the predictive
networks, which presents challenges in the practical applications (Feng
et al., 2023). In addition, most of the ML-based methods of S-wave ve­
locity prediction are purely based on the data-driven concepts. The pure
data-driven ML method might lack the possibility for revealing the
intrinsic physical insights (Wang et al., 2023b,c).
This work proposes a S-wave velocity prediction method based on
DNNs which assumes the mathematical formulation (theoretical model)
describing the elastic wave propagation within the reservoirs is known.
The elastic parameters are considered as unknowns and are learned
through a NN on the basis of well log data. Subsequently, the corre­
sponding P- and S-wave velocities are obtained with the plane-wave
analysis method by combining the NN approach and the theoretical
model. In this process, we first verify that ML can learn the wave
propagation equations from the labeled data. Then, we analyze the er­
rors between the S-wave velocity obtained by solving the wave equation
learned by the network and the actual data. We also consider two cases
for the network training, i.e., all S-wave velocity labels are available and
only part of them are available. The proposed DNN-based model is
compared to RPMs (the traditional Xu-White model and the reformu­
lated model which incorporates the depth-variation pore aspect ratio).
To evaluate the performance, the log data from the three wells that
provide abundant information in the study area are adopted. The
established DNN model and the reformulated RPM are separately
applied for S-wave velocity prediction, and the results are compared and
analyzed with those by the traditional Xu-White model.

However, reliable empirical relations require the statistical analysis of
extensive data from the specific area or target layer. Although it is
efficient and practical, the approach may only reflect general trends and
can be heavily influenced by regional variations (either horizontally or
vertically), which potentially reduces the degree of accuracy in esti­
mation. The RPM-based method primarily utilizes different types of
theories or models according to the real geological conditions (Jian
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2021), and computes the
equivalent elastic moduli of rocks to obtain the P- and S-wave velocities.
Xu and White (1995, 1996) proposed a rock physics modeling approach
for sand and mudstone formations, by combining the differential
effective medium (DEM) theory (Zimmerman, 1984; Norris, 1985),
Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model (Kuster and Toksöz, 1974) and Gassmann’s
equation of fluid substitution (Gassmann, 1951). Subsequently, based on
rock physics models and theories, a series of S-wave prediction models
are presented, which can be suitable for different lithological reservoirs
(Keys and Xu, 2002; Qi et al., 2019; Azadpour et al., 2020; Ren et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2021; Han et al., 2022; Ba et al.,
2023a). In practice, for the process of rock physics modeling, it is
necessary to accurately determine the various influencing factors, such
as rock mineral compositions and geometries, pore structure and con­
nectivity, and pore fluid properties, etc., so as to develop an appropriate
RPM according to the specific reservoir conditions and achieve the ac­
curate prediction.
The ability of machine learning (ML), such as DNN, to establish
complex nonlinear mapping relationships between inputs and outputs
has led to its extensive applications in the fields such as facial recogni­
tion, machine translation, image classification, etc. (Zhao et al., 2003;
Zhang et al., 2014; Young et al., 2018; Boateng and Fu, 2018; Boateng
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023). In recent years, ML was introduced into the
field of geosciences with significant results in the areas such as rock
physics modeling, lithology identification, and reservoir parameter
inversion (Fu, 2004; Wu et al., 2008; Rajabi et al., 2010; Anemangely
et al., 2017; Alfarraj and AlRegib, 2019; You et al., 2020, 2021; Xiong
et al., 2021a, 2021b; Zou et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023a; Botterill and
McMillan, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Most ML techniques are purely data
driven, which does not require any prior physical information. Such
purely data-driven learning requires massive training data. It is worth
mentioning that physics-informed learning can be obtained by embed­
ding relevant RPMs into the ML algorithms (Qin and Fu, 2013; Boateng
et al., 2017). For example, Cheng and Fu (2022) propose a

are particularly abundant in the Changqing Oilfield. In recent years, the
Chang 7 Member has emerged as a key exploration target. Fig. 1 shows
the lithological distribution in this area. Chang 71 is composed of
mudstone interbedded with siltstone/sandstone, as well as oil shale.
Chang 72 consists of siltstone and fine sandstone, locally interbedded
with sandy mudstone, and additionally, thin layers of shale are devel­
oped. Chang 73 is mainly composed of black oil shale and siltstones (Fu
et al., 2020a,b).
Fig. 2 shows the cast thin sections of tight sandstone rocks observed
in the laboratory, which indicates the rock has a fine-silty sandy struc­
ture with directional clastic particles, belonging to the fine-silty struc­
ture lithic feldspathic sandstone. The major mineral components of the
rocks are quartz, feldspar, and clay, with lower volumetric content of
other minerals. The ratio of quartz to feldspar is approximately 1.85.
After diagenetic transformation, the rock is relatively tight, and only
intergranular residual pores and feldspar dissolution pores can be
observed. Complex pore structures bring challenges to rock physics
modeling. Pore aspect ratio is commonly used in rock physics modeling
to characterize pore morphology and structure. However, in practical
applications, pore aspect ratio is difficult to be directly measured.

2.1. Overview of the study area
The Ordos Basin located in western China is a vast and stable poly­
genetic craton basin featuring a gently inclined monocline towards the
west (Guo et al., 2020). It can be divided into six distinct tectonic units,
with the Tianhuan Depression and the Shanbei Slope being the most
prominent units (as illustrated in Fig. 1). These units also correspond to
regions with significant hydrocarbon deposits. Notably, the Shanbei
Slope is the primary area for Paleozoic natural gas and Mesozoic oil
distribution. Over time, starting from the Late Triassic era, the Ordos
Basin has been transitioned into an inland lacustrine sedimentary
environment, where the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation contains a
series of fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine clastic rocks. The Yanchang Formation
can be further subdivided into ten members, including the Chang 7
Member (Bai and Ma, 2020). The study area is positioned at the
convergence point of sediment sources for the southwest and northeast
of the basin. The hydrocarbons presented in the tight sandstones and
source rocks have not undergone long-distance migration and accumu­
lation, which are defined as a variety of high-quality shale/tight oil, and

2.2. Data preparation

3. Theory and methodology

The dataset comprises well log measurements obtained from 16 wells
located within the study area. Following the preprocessing of the data,
we acquired a total of 21,215 data points from the wells. These data
points are suitable for training and testing our models, and they
encompass all the necessary variables. The quantity of data points may
differ across different wells. For evaluating the model performance, we
selected three wells with sufficient data points as an independent test
data set. The remaining wells, comprising 12,415 data points, were used
to train the DNN model. Fig. 3 shows the data information from one of
the wells, including porosity (ϕ), water saturation (Sw), clay content
(Vcl), density (ρ), permeability (κ), and P-wave and S-wave velocities (Vp
and Vs). These data were processed and interpreted by the oilfield
companies. Porosity, water saturation, clay content, and density were
calculated with the conventional well logging curves. Permeability was
calculated based on a regional model established through fitting with
parameters such as porosity, and using core calibration logging. P- and
S-wave velocities were extracted from array sonic logs.

The elastic parameters of the wave propagation equations in the
study area are determined by using the DNN and RPM, respectively,
based on which the corresponding S-wave velocity can be obtained by
plane wave analysis.

3.1. Poroelasticity wave equations with viscoelastic fluid
Ba et al. (2023b) derived the wave propagation equations of a porous
media saturated with a viscoelastic fluid, where the stress-strain rela­
tionship of the fluid is characterized by a Kelvin-Voigt mechanical model
(Kelvin, 1875; Voigt, 1892). By invoking Hamilton’s principle and the
Lagrangian equation of L = T-W (where T and W are the kinetic energy
and strain energy, respectively. All of this can be determined according
to Ba et al. (2023b)), the governing equations of wave propagation are as

In this work, we adopt the wave propagation equations (Ba et al.,

determined.

In this section, we consider the assumption that elastic wave prop­
agation in the oil reservoirs can be appropriately described with Eq. (1),
while the six unknown elastic parameters in Eq. (2) can be determined
with the DNN training from the actual log data. The workflow of the
DNN-based method is outlined in Fig. 4. The DNN is designed with input
and output layers, between which there are five fully-connected hidden
layers (each layer has fifty units). In the NN, we select the rectified linear
unit (ReLU) as the activation function and utilize the adaptive moment
estimation (Adam) algorithm as the optimization technique (Kingma
and Ba, 2014). In the training, we set 0.01 as the initial learning rate and
choose the learning rate decay strategy. The learning process is based on
the ’lr_schedule’ function, i.e., an integrated feature in PyTorch that
facilitates learning rate adjustment as the number of epochs progresses
(Paszke et al., 2017). Besides, weights and biases are continuously
adjusted to minimize the loss function. The loss function is the mean
square error (MSE), quantifying the discrepancy between the DNN
predictions and the provided labels. In the process of the NN training, all
the data in the training set are utilized in each epoch.
Through Eq. (2), it is known that the six elastic parameters are de­
pends on ϕ, Ks , μs , and Kf . In this case, we assume that the bulk and shear
moduli of fluid-saturated rock (K and μ) are related to Ks and μs , and Kf is
̃ = (ϕ, K, μ, Sw ), and the DNN models
related to Sw . Therefore, the input Z

rock, respectively, μf , μs and μb are the shear moduli of the fluid, min­
eral, and dry rock, respectively, ηK and ημ are the bulk viscosity and

3.3.1. The K-T model
The estimation of elastic moduli of dry rock is an important aspect in
rock physics modeling process (Keys and Xu, 2002; Tan et al., 2015).
Kuster and Toksöz (1974) utilized the pore aspect ratio (α) to quantify
pore geometry. Based on the scattering theory, the relation between
elastic moduli, porosity, and pore geometry of rock is established (the
so-called K-T model). Then, Xu and White (1995) developed the
Xu-White model based on the K-T model to compute elastic moduli of
dry rock for predicting S-wave velocity. The equations of K-T model are,

increases about 10 GPa from αs = 0.2 to αs = 0.6 given αc = 0.04.
Therefore, we should take into account the impact of the aspect ratio on
the elastic properties of rocks with complex pore structures in the
modeling process.
3.3.3. Rock physics modeling
In this section, we propose a new RPM-based S-wave prediction
method by combining the V-R-H (Voigt-Reuss-Hill) average, decoupled
K-T model, and poroelasticity theory with viscoelastic fluid. The major
differences from the conventional Xu-White model are that the pore
aspect ratio varies with depth and the intrinsic viscous characteristics of
fluid is incorporated in the rock physics modeling. Fig. 6 outlines the
workflow of the proposed RPM-based S-wave prediction as follows.

1980).
When the K-T model is applied to compute the elastic moduli of dry
rock, the bulk and shear moduli are coupled. To simplify the modeling
process, Keys and Xu (2002) assume that Poisson’s ratio of the dry rock
frame does not change with porosity, and the equations are transformed
into a system of linear ordinary differential equations. The elastic
moduli of dry rock are

3.3.2. Analysis of pore aspect ratio
When the Xu-White model is used to predict S-wave velocity, the
pore aspect ratio assigned to clay- and sand-related pores are set as
0.035 and 0.10, respectively. But there may exist other factors that can
influence the pore aspect ratio, including the pressure, fluid composi­
tion, lithology, diagenetic history, and sedimentary environment (Guo
et al., 2021). Therefore, if it is assumed that the pore aspect ratio of
reservoirs is fixed within a large depth range, it could potentially lead to
inaccuracies or limitations in the prediction of elastic properties.
Fig. 5 shows the influence of the pore aspect ratio on the elastic
moduli of dry rock. It can be observed that the different values of αc and

analysis results of samples from the target reservoir formation indicate
that the major mineral components of the rocks are quartz, feldspar, and
clay, with minor volumetric content of other minerals. The ratio of
quartz to feldspar is approximately 1.85. In the process of calculating the
matrix moduli, the minerals are considered with quartz, feldspar, and
clay, and the clay content is determined based on the clay content curve

4. Results
4.1. Results with the DNN model
For training the DNN-based S-wave velocity prediction model, the
data set of training model composed of 21,215 data points from 16 wells
are selected. The data points of wells #1-#3 (8800 data points in total)
are used to verify the DNN model performance and analyze the pre­
diction accuracy. The loss value during the training process is shown in
Fig. 7. It is apparent that the training loss gradually decreases, reaching a
minimum value after 1656 epochs. The convergence indicates that
overfitting is absent, and the trained DNN model possesses reliable
generalization capabilities. The comparison between the predicted Pand S-wave velocities obtained from the DNN model (blue curves) and
the actual log data (black curves) are illustrated in Fig. 8. It is showed
that the prediction obtained by the DNN model exhibits a good agree­
ment with the log data.
For the constructed DNN model, the relative RMSE and R2 are
computed with the velocity predictions of the three wells, which are
listed in Table 2. The relative RMSE for the P- and S-wave velocity
predictions based on the DNN model falls within the range from 0.0081
to 0.0169, with R2 values ranging from 0.9652 to 0.9917. Overall, the
errors are small. A correlation analysis is conducted to compare the
results of DNN model prediction with the actual data. As is shown in
Figs. 9–11, the prediction results exhibit a strong correlation with the
actual data, with data scatters are mostly distributed nearby the stan­
dard line.
Using the same DNN as is shown in Fig. 4 (with all hyperparameters
being set the same), where the input and output are Z and (Vp, Vs),
respectively. In addition, A normalization of the input and output

from the log data. The physical properties of minerals and fluids are
given in Table 1.
Step 2 Estimate the bulk and shear moduli of dry rock frame by using
the decoupled K-T model (Eq. (10)). Then, the P- and S-wave
velocities of a saturated rock are obtained with Eq. (3).
Step 3 To address the complex pore structures, we incorporate the
variation of pore aspect ratios with respect to depth in the pre­
diction of S-wave velocity. By considering the aspect ratios of
clay- and sand-related pores as unknown variables, they can be
determined by solving the optimization problem calibrated by
real log data, i.e.,

(12)
(̂
where Vp− pre is the P- wave velocity predicted by RPM, and Vp− well is the
P-wave velocity from the log data. In practice, the ranges of αc and αs are
set as 0.001–0.1 and 0.1–0.4, respectively.
In addition, according to Nur and Simmons (1969), there may exist a
statistical correlation between porosity and sand-related pore aspect
ratio, therefore an extra prior constraint can be provided for estimating
pore aspect ratio, which is

αs = 0.1762 exp− 2.22ϕ

quantities are needed before training because the magnitudes differ
(Xiong et al., 2021b). Subsequently, the prediction performance is
evaluated with the same test dataset (wells #1-#3). The comparison
between the predicted P- and S-wave velocities obtained from the
Re-trained DNN model (green curves) and the actual log data (black
curves) are illustrated in Fig. 12. It is showed that the direct prediction

obtained by the Re-trained DNN model also exhibits a good agreement
with the log data.

Table 4 lists R2 and relative RMSE of Vs predictions for the three
DNN-based models. In three cases, the errors of relative RMSE are less
5%. When the S-wave velocity in actual log data is available, both the
DNN-based poroelasticity model and the Re-trained DNN model can
predict S-wave velocity with a good precision. When the S-wave velocity
is absent or only a few data points are available, it is impossible to utilize
DNN to establish the relationship between Z1 and Vs. The DNN-based
poroelasticity model can predict the S-wave velocity when Vs labels
are available or only a few data points are available, compared to the
DNN model trained with full data, that with partial data gives a rela­
tively lower R2, but it still maintains a good level of precision. The
analysis indicates that, even under the situations with limited Vs infor­
mation, the proposed DNN-based poroelasticity method can predict Vs
with acceptable precision.
The DNN model trained with partial Vs data is compared to the three
commonly used empirical formulas (as is shown in Table 5). The
empirical formulas are derived from the calibration of a large dataset but
may not be universally applicable for the different areas and target
formations. Consequently, in predicting Vs of wells #1-#3, the empirical
formulas exhibit significant errors (as are depicted in Figs. 14–16). The
DNN model yields improved prediction accuracy with the better
agreement with the real data. The average relative errors between the
log data and predictions in Figs. 14–16 are summarized in Table 6.

comparing Tables 2 and 3 and it is showed that the Re-trained DNN
model has a slightly higher prediction accuracy for well # 2 compared to
the DNN-based poroelasticity model. However, for wells # 1 and #3, the
prediction results are lower than those with the DNN-based poroelas­
ticity model. Especially for well # 3, R2 between the log data and pre­
diction results are lower by 0.049 and 0.0401 for P- and S-wave
velocities, respectively, which could be attributed to the relatively poor
quality of well # 3 data. Overall, the errors of the Re-trained DNN and
DNN-based poroelasticity models are small, but the DNN-based poroe­
lasticity model shows lower requirements for data quantity and quality
and is physically clear in describing the wave propagations.
By considering the possible absence of S-wave velocity in actual log
data, where K and μ cannot be determined based on P- and S-wave ve­
locities and density, we introduce the P-wave modulus. The process
illustrated in Fig. 4 is repeated with the parameters Z1 = (ϕ, ϒ, ρ, κ, Sw )
̃1 = (ϕ, ϒ, κ, Sw ), and a new DNN model is trained with the same
and Z
dataset. Subsequently, the prediction performance is evaluated with the
same test dataset (wells #1-#3).
In the process of constructing a poroelasticity model based on DNN,
the entire Vp data are used, while different Vs data are considered in the
process of DNN training. Additionally, we use the same network archi­
tecture, with inputs and outputs as Z1 and Vs, respectively. Another DNN
model is retrained (Re-trained DNN model). Fig. 13 shows the pre­
dictions of S-wave velocity for the three specific cases, in which the
black curve denotes the log data, the blue curve is the prediction result
of the DNN-based poroelasticity model trained with all Vs data, the
brown curve is the prediction result of the Re-trained DNN model, and
the orange curve is the prediction result of DNN-based poroelasticity
model trained with partial Vs data (ten Vs labels). All of the three DNNbased models can provide reasonable predictions.

4.2. Results with the RPM
The RPM proposed in Section 3.3.3 is employed to predict Vs for
wells #1-#3, and is compared with the classical Xu-White model. The
physical parameters of fluid and minerals for the prediction procedure
are given in Table 1. Figs. 17–19 shows the comparisons between the
14

Z. Fang et al.

predictions by the two RPMs and the actual log data (the black curve
gives the log data, the red curve denotes the reformulated RPM, and the
blue curve denotes the Xu-White model). The relative errors of pre­
dictions of the two models are computed. It is showed that the RPM
predictions are better consistent with the log data. The error is less than
10% (mainly within 5%) for the proposed model, while the error is
generally more than 10% for the Xu-White model. The average relative
errors of prediction results for the two models are computed for the three
wells, which are 3.57%, 4.76%, and 3.34%, and 5.25%, 13.1%, and
8.01%, for the RPM and Xu-White model, respectively. The proposed
model improves the prediction precision of Vs.
Fig. 20 displays the relative errors of predictions with the DNN model
(trained with partial Vs data), RPM, and Xu-White model with histo­
grams. As is shown in Fig. 20, both the proposed DNN model and RPM
improve the prediction result. The prediction errors of the DNN model
exhibit a relatively narrow distribution, with the average relative errors
of 2.06%, 3.39% and 2.78% for the three wells, which indicates more
reliable and accurate predictions. In contrast, RPM gives the relative
errors mostly within 10%, while the Xu-White model exhibits larger
errors. Therefore, provided a sufficient data set, the DNN-based
approach yields better Vs predictions compared to the traditional rock
physics modeling. Notably, although the traditional modeling is inde­
pendent of data quantity, the reformulated RPM for Vs prediction can
still provide valuable references under the limited data condition.

method. However, the DNN model is dependent on data quantity and
usually relies on sufficient training data to achieve more accurate pre­
dictions, especially for the DNN model that directly outputs wave ve­
locities. On the other hand, compared to the Xu-White model, the
reformulated RPM better characterizes the pore structures within com­
plex reservoirs and thereby predicts S-wave velocity with higher preci­
sion. This work employs a fully-connected NN, while different NNs
might be considered for a comparative analysis in future studies.

5. Conclusion

Data availability

This study focuses on the comparisons of S-wave velocity prediction
with the DNN- and RPM-based methods in the tight reservoirs of the
Chang 7 shale oil formation, Ordos Basin. Based on the assumption that
the mathematical formulation that describes the elastic wave propaga­
tion within the reservoirs is known (the poroelasticity equations with
viscoelastic fluid), DNN model is trained to obtain elastic parameters
and subsequently predict S-wave velocity. In contrast to the classic XuWhite model, a reformulated RPM for predicting S-wave velocity is also
developed by considering the variation of pore aspect ratio with depth.
The two methods are tested with log data from the three wells in the
work area and achieve good precision. In general, the DNN-based
approach shows a better prediction performance compared to the RPM
