Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is one of the most critical issues in the field of seismic exploration
and has long been the focus of numerous experts and scholars. In recent years, the advancement
of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity
inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on
machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory
and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic
velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave
equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating
through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave
equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe
the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes
into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from
multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield
snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the
observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of
the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations
as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal
information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated.
Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality
of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the
method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures.

1. Introduction
Seismic waveform inversion is an essential geophysical method that enables the
inversion of physical parameters of the subsurface medium, such as velocity, density, and
elastic moduli, from seismic data [1]. These parameters are of great significance in fields
such as oil and gas exploration, earthquake hazard assessment, and geological structure
analysis [2]. However, seismic waveform inversion is also a non-linear, multi-modal, nonconvex optimization problem and faces various challenges, such as dependency on initial
models, susceptibility to local minima traps, and high computational complexity [3].
To overcome these challenges, deep learning techniques have been introduced to
seismic inversion. Röth and Tarantola were the first to propose the use of neural networks
to transform time-domain seismic data into acoustic velocity models in 1994 [4]. Nath
et al., in 1999, trained neural networks with synthetic data, resulting in networks capable of

estimating formation velocities using inter-well data [5,6]. In 2019, Yang and Ma developed
a fully convolutional neural network for inverting P-wave velocity models from raw seismic
data [7]. A commonality among these networks is the need for extensive labeled data for
training, and once trained, the neural networks can be used as inversion solvers. However,
in the field of seismic exploration, acquiring a large labeled dataset is challenging.
Physics-Embedded Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a novel approach to seismic velocity modeling [8]. The fundamental idea behind PINNs is to use neural networks to
approximate unknown functions or parameters and incorporate the residuals of physical
equations as part of the loss function. The neural networks are trained by minimizing
this loss function, resulting in solutions that satisfy physical constraints [9]. Moseley et al.
(2020) utilized PINNs as solvers for acoustic wave forward propagation [10,11], while
Smith et al. [12] and Waheed et al. [13] applied PINNs to the Eikonal equation for firstarrival prediction and travel-time tomography, respectively. Song et al. employed PINNs to
solve the frequency-domain anisotropic acoustic wave equation [14]. Additionally, PINNs
have been successfully used for forward and inverse analyses of various complex systems
in cases with limited sensor measurements [15–20] or without labeled data [21–25].
The recurrent neural network, as a special kind of neural network, introduces a time
dependence, which is more compatible with the wave field propagation process. In this
paper, a recurrent neural network is used to simulate the two-dimensional time-domain
finite-difference acoustic wave equation as the forward process using a similar idea of
full-waveform inverse forward simulation combined with backpropagation correction,
and the velocity is used as a network parameter [26]. The velocity model is updated
during the backward propagation of the network. This approach enables the integration of
information from the acoustic wave equation into the network, guiding the optimization
direction of the network, and avoiding explicit solutions for wavefields and gradients,
thereby reducing computational costs. Furthermore, it leverages the non-linear fitting
capabilities of neural networks to enhance inversion accuracy and robustness. Additionally,
given the temporal causality in wavefields, where the current computed wavefield is
related to previous wavefields, this paper adopts a time-lapse inversion approach. This
ensures that the residuals of the wavefields are minimized at each timestep, guaranteeing
the accuracy of subsequent wavefield computations and alleviating the non-uniqueness
issue in velocity inversion. The effectiveness and superiority of the method proposed in
this paper are verified through numerical experiments.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Finite-Difference Acoustic Wave Equation
The numerical simulation of wave equation forward modeling is fundamental to
inversion. The time-space domain finite difference algorithm is widely used in geophysical forward modeling due to its simplicity and high computational efficiency, and it is
employed to simulate the propagation of seismic waves. In the process of solving partial
differential wave equations using the finite difference method, the computation area is
first discretized into a grid, then grid differences are utilized to approximate the derivative
operators, and the wave equation is converted into a difference equation.
In a 2D isotropic acoustic medium, the time-domain wave equation is

∇2 u(r, t) =

1
v2 ( r )

·

∂u2 (r, t)
+ s(r, t)δ(r − rs )
∂t2

(1)

where ∇u2 (r, t) represents the pressure or displacement at coordinate r at time t, V2 (r)
represents the speed of sound at coordinate r, s(r, t) represents the source function at
coordinate r at time t, and δ(r − rs ) is a Dirac (Delta) function, indicating that energy is
released only at the source position.
For the 2D medium, spatial discretization is undertaken by converting coordinates
(x, y) into grid points (i, j), where i represents the index in the x direction and j represents

propagation, the sum of the losses of the wavefield at each time step and its preceding
time steps is computed to calculate the total loss. The model parameters are updated
according to the total loss to ensure the correctness of the wavefield at the current time step.
Compared to the traditional method of independently calculating the loss and updating
the network at each time step or calculating the sum of the losses for all time steps, this
method has significant advantages. Firstly, step-by-step inversion not only minimizes the
overall residual but also ensures that the residual of the wavefield at each time step is as
small as possible. In addition, by ensuring that the residual of the wavefield at the previous
time step is small before propagating to the next time step, this method incorporates causal
information of wavefield propagation, satisfying the propagation conditions of the acoustic
wave equation. This avoids errors at the current time step that could be caused by errors
from the previous time step, improving the accuracy of the inversion. By using a velocity
model that has been partially corrected through inversion as the network parameters for
the next time step, the initial model for the next time step inversion is altered, which can
alleviate the dependency on the initial model in velocity inversion.
The mean squared error loss is calculated at each time step by comparing the output
with the label:
2
δdt = (d t − d′ t
(6)
where dt is the output of the network at time t, and d′ t is the label sequence at time t. The
residual at time t used for computing the gradient through backpropagation is:
t

losst = ∑ ∑ δdt
rs

(7)

0

where rs represents different shot gathers. The corrections to the model parameters can be
derived from the derivatives of the total losses to the parameters:

∂V(r, t)

(9)

g(r) =

g(r) = ∑

where the partial derivatives of the loss with respect to the wave field can be computed by
Equation (4) and the backpropagation of the network is accomplished by passing the computation to the initial moment through the chain rule. After obtaining the parameter update
quantity, the parameters are updated by Equation (10), which show the learning rate.
Vn + 1 ( r ) = Vn ( r ) − A · g ( r )

(10)

The gradient is propagated through the chain rule, so the velocity correction is related
to dt , which causes the residual. Through the two-dimensional finite difference acoustic
wave equation in the time domain (5), it is known that dt is related to the velocity model
and the wavefields of the previous two time steps. The spatial domain variations at
different time steps are caused by the difference in the wavefields of the previous time
step. Therefore, the range of velocity correction gradually expands with the range of the
wavefield. Through the step-by-step correction algorithm in the time domain, the velocity
model can be gradually corrected in the spatial domain, starting from the source and
progressively correcting the velocity model in all directions. The gradual correction in
the spatial domain makes the inversion parameters smaller, thereby reducing the nonuniqueness of the inversion problem. Moreover, a more accurate shallow velocity can
improve the accuracy and stability of deep velocity corrections. The schematic diagram of
the step-by-step inversion process is shown in Figure 6.

Inversion. The inversion results are closer to the true model. Moreover, by employing a
time-stepped inversion, which takes into account the propagation of waves, the accuracy
of the preceding wavefield is ensured. This, in turn, leads to more precise calculations in
subsequent wavefield propagations, manifesting in the inversion results as more accurate
representations on the lateral sides and deeper regions of the model.

improving the accuracy and stability of the inversion. Overall, the time-by-time inversion
can achieve more accurate results than the overall inversion, but it may require longer
computation time in the case of large initial model errors. The effectiveness and superiority
of the method proposed in this paper are verified by numerical experiments.
