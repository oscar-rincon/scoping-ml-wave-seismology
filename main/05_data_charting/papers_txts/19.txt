Abstract
In this paper, we consider the axial motion of a directional multi-sectional drill-string. The drillstring dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with
an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction
between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in
safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our
knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational
framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks
while drilling. By exploiting the derived models’ particular structure, we combine the drill-string
dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to
estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and
model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic
while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks’ intrinsic
energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based
on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis. The
different approaches are tested and validated in simulations. We discuss their respective advantages
and drawbacks. Finally, we show how to extend our methodologies in the presence of non-linear
Coulomb friction terms and of coupled axial-torsional oscillations.

1. Introduction

5

Knowledge of the subsurface reservoirs, such as hydrocarbons, minerals, and geothermal, and an
efficient method for accessing them are crucial in exploring and exploiting the reserves. Accessing
the reservoirs involves a drilling process. In drilling, the interaction with the rock can generate
significant vibrations and result in an inefficient Rate Of Penetration (ROP). It may also raise
safety issues. Control mechanisms may reduce these vibrations in the system [? ? ]. However, such
control mechanisms often depend on the properties of the drilled rock. In this paper, we design
three algorithms that provide a near-real-time estimation of the rock’s nature for a directional
multi-sectional well.

1.1. Insights in modeling drill-string dynamics: Complexity and related issues
Drill-string dynamic behavior often manifests itself as drill string vibrations. These vibrations
have been extensively studied in the literature [? ? ? ? ]. Among them, torsional oscillations,
known as stick-slip, are characterized by a series of stopping – ”sticking” – and releasing – ”slipping”
– events of the bit. These oscillations can reduce the Rate of Penetration, damage the well by
causing fatigue on the equipment, and eventually lead to premature failure of the bit [? ]. Such
oscillations are caused by Coulomb friction-induced side forces [? ] and by non-linear frictional
force actuating at the bit by contact with the rock [? ? ]. Indeed, numerous models consider those
stick-slip oscillations are related to the velocity-weakening of the frictional force at the bit (Stribecklike effect) associated with typical dry friction profiles (static friction and dynamic friction) [? ?
]. However, the stick-slip phenomenon can also occur off-bottom and does not require a velocity
weakening in the bit-rock interaction [? ? ? ]. In this context, to reduce the harmful effects of such
vibrations and improve the drilling device’s performance, it appears necessary to clearly understand
the dynamics of the drill-string. In [? ? ], the axial and torsional dynamics are described by a
set of hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These equations are usually governed
by wave equations combined with gravitational terms and a non-linear Coulomb side-force [? ].
In the case of multi-sectional wells, the change of the characteristic line impedance between each
section may reflect the traveling waves [? ? ]. These reflections are taken into account in the
model using interconnection between the PDEs [? ]. Such a class of distributed models has been
extensively analyzed in [? ? ]. A validation against field data for the corresponding torsional
model has been proposed in [? ]. Regarding the boundary conditions, specific attention must be
paid to the bit-rock interaction law at the downhole boundary [? ? ? ]. Different models have
been proposed in the literature [? ] to represent the contact between the cutting device and the
drilling surface. For instance, the approach developed in [? ] for drag bits and adjusted in [? ] for
roller-cone bit divides the tool’s action into three independent processes: a pure cutting process, a
pure indentation process, and a frictional contact process. Such a model is shown to be consistent
with laboratory results in [? ]. All in all, the drilling system can be modeled as interconnected
hyperbolic PDEs coupled with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) at their boundaries. In
that sense, they are related to the larger class of flexible systems for which extensive literature
already exist [? ? ? ? ]. Note that other models have been proposed in [? ? ] for percussive
drilling systems.or When trying to deal with vibration control for drilling systems, a problem that
naturally arises is that such drilling models depend on the nature of the drilled rock (which is a
priori unknown) The dependence of the drill-string dynamic response to the bit-rock interaction
and rock properties is verified in [? ]. Accordingly, estimating the drilled rock’s characteristics (such
as its seismic velocity or its intrinsic specific energy) appears necessary to improve drilling devices’
performance. Estimating rocks’ seismic velocities while drilling is not an easy task as downhole
sensors are expensive and may raise potential technical risks. Thus, the disturbance observer
developed in [? ? ? ] cannot be straightforwardly adjusted (since the downhole measurements
are not available). To address this problem, an approach based on seismic while drilling (SWD)
has been proposed in [? ]. Seismic-while-drilling is a technique that records the seismic energy
of the drill-bit rock interactions in the nearby well locations or near the surface [? ]. SWD has
several applications. For example, SWD measurements can provide the drill-bit position through
check shots or sonic calibrations through reflectivity characterization [? ]. Imaging SWD data can
provide subsurface structure around and ahead of the drill-bit [? ? ]. Moreover, full-waveform
inversion of SWD data can result in the high-resolution estimation of rocks’ seismic properties in

the sub-surface [? ]. Here, we extend the formation seismic velocity estimation method of [?
], which is designed for uni-sectional vertical well, to a directional multi-sectional well without
considering Coulomb friction or torsional motion. In drilling environments where recording the
SWD data is not feasible or lacks quality, we need to explore alternative options. Since the method
developed in [? ] provides an expression of the downhole force and velocity as functions of topdrive measurements, it is possible to use classical parameter estimations techniques [? ] on the
downhole boundary condition to estimate the rock properties. Also, machine learning approaches
are efficient in estimating parameters based on available measurement signals [? ? ].
1.2. Towards a unified methodology of modeling, sensing, analysis, and control
One of the practical problems arising in drilling consists of deriving an appropriate real-time
estimation of the nature of the drilled rock. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, such a problem
has not received a satisfactory answer in the open literature. In our opinion, the proposed results
and underlying ideas represent a new step in deriving an appropriate engineering-based solution.
More precisely, the main contributions of the paper are twofold: (i) first, improving the drill-string
dynamics parameters’ estimations of the nature of the drilled rock in some unified dynamical model
based on a better understanding of the underlying transport phenomena by exploiting the dynamics
interconnection as well as the interconnection structure of the corresponding process; (ii) second,
explicitly presenting three algorithms to estimate the seismic velocity of the rock, the energy of
the rock interacting with the drill-bit.
To improve the parameter estimation, we will propose a recursive dynamics interconnection
framework allowing us to reduce the existing gap between modeling and estimation in the context
of complex dynamics as whose described by PDEs to represent drilling dynamics. In our opinion,
such a recursive interconnection framework is better adapted to sensing and estimation since it
allows structuring the model on some simpler and more realistic interconnected dynamical subsystems (blocks) and better exploiting the structure of the interconnection. To the best of the authors’
knowledge, this framework represents a novelty in the open literature allowing a global estimation,
analysis, and control of the corresponding process with a reduced computational cost. It is worth
mentioning that the computational effort is essential when one of the focuses is on real-time estimations. Finally, this framework is a natural environment to develop estimation techniques (as it
is done in this paper) or to solve control problems (for instance by adjusting the recent Lyapunov
techniques developed for flexible systems in [? ? ? ? ] or the thrust force control methodology
developed in [? ]), to develop efficient state-observers [? ].
Second, in the proposed framework, we present three algorithms to estimate the specific intrinsic
energy of the rock interacting with the drill-bit. We consider the case of the axial motion of a
directional multi-sectional well, for which we neglect the Coulomb friction forces. However, we
show how to extend our procedures in the presence of Coulomb non-linear friction force acting on
the well and to coupled axial-torsional oscillations. Such a characterization of the formation is a new
step towards a subsurface-aware drilling system. The first algorithm uses SWD measurements and
drill-string dynamics modeling. The algorithm matches the processed direct arrivals of primary
and secondary waveforms to the modeled radiation patterns to estimate rocks’ seismic velocity
while drilling. To model the radiation patterns, we use drill-string dynamics modeling and topdrive measurements to simulate the force-on-bit. The second algorithm is based on parameter
estimation techniques applied to the model we have for the bit-rock interaction boundary condition.
Such estimation techniques are classical, but we believe that their development in the proposed
framework is a novelty. Finally, our last algorithm is based on a machine learning approach.

Computing the top-drive measured signals’ spectra, we train a neural network that estimates the
rock’s nature. In that sense, our approach is related to the results developed in [? ? ? ]

The proposed paper presents a new theoretical framework (which is a novelty in terms of
systems theory) that is applied to a complex petroleum engineering problem (estimation of the
axial motion of a drilling system and the nature of the rock interacting with the drill-bit). More
precisely, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• From a mathematical point of view, we develop in this paper a new recursive dynamics interconnection framework. Although this framework is developed here on a drilling application,
it can be extended to a large class of balance laws systems [? ]. This framework is a natural
environment to develop estimation techniques with a reduced computational cost. We believe
it is an important contribution from the system theory perspective.
• From a petroleum engineering point of view, we apply our recursive framework to estimate
the axial motion of the drill-string, which is a novelty and represents a step towards automated closed-loop geosteering. The distributed model we use to describe the axial dynamics
is based on recent contributions [? ? ] and captures a large part of the possible dynamics
for a significantly extended range of well lengths and surveys compared to the more standard lumped approximations. The development of estimation techniques for this class of
distributed model is a novelty as most of the contributions in the literature either deal with
finite-dimensional approximations of the drilling device (to apply already existing techniques
as Kalman’s filter [? ]) or develop operational settings to measure the downhole state directly. The long latency (1 to 20 s) of downhole telemetry has made automatic feedback
control significantly slower than manual control [? ? ], which reduces its interest in terms of
control application.
• The third contribution consists of using the estimation of the drill-bit source signature to
estimate the nature of the rock interacting with the drill-bit. Although the three proposed
algorithms are based on existing techniques (SWD, machine-learning, and parameter estimation techniques), their application in this context constitutes an innovation.
• Finally, the last contribution of this paper consists of two extensions on how to adjust the
proposed approach to coupled axial-torsional oscillations and the presence of Coulomb friction
terms.
Note that the different algorithms are tested in simulations against reliable models. These models
are accepted by a large part of the petroleum engineering community as reliable. Extended simulations have been proposed in [? ? ] to test these models and all the trends predicted by the
models are supported by field measurements [? ]. However, complete validation of the proposed
approach would require several tests against field data. We believe that the development of an
experimental setting is outside this paper’s scope and would be a contribution by itself.
1.4. Paper structure and notations
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the mechanical and sensing systems
under consideration. In Section 3, we derive a distributed model that describes the axial dynamics
4

of the drill-string. As we consider a multi-sectional drill-string, specific attention is paid to the
connections between the different pipes. In Section 4, we express the drill-bit axial force and the
drill-bit velocity as functions of the top-drive force and velocity by using an iterative backstepping
approach. In Section 5, we present three algorithms to compute the specific intrinsic energy of
the drilled rock. The first algorithm uses seismic-while-drilling technique, the second is based on
direct parameter estimation, and the third algorithm uses a neural network. Simulation results are
given in Section 6. Also, we compare the advantages and drawbacks of each algorithm. Finally,
we extend our approach to the case of non-linear Coulomb side-forces and coupled axial-torsional
dynamics in Section 7.

We consider in this paper the mechanical part of a drilling system. A drilling device comprises
three components: the surface drill rig, which includes a rotating mechanism (usually a rotary
table or a top drive suspended over the drill floor by the traveling block), the drill string, and
the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA). The torsional and axial motions generated at the surface are
transferred to the drill string and the BHA. The drill string is an interconnection of pipes that
are steel tubes with a length of typically 10 m. These pipes are usually run in tension to avoid
the effect of fatigue due to a potential helical buckling. They are hollow so that a mud pump
can inject a drilling fluid to clean, cool, and lubricate the bit to evacuate the rock cuttings. The
BHA comprises the bit (a rock cutting device), a series of relatively heavy pipe sections, known
as drill collars (much thicker pipes that provide the necessary weight to perform the perforation),
stabilizers (at least two spaced apart) which prevent the drill string from unbalancing, and ”shock
subs” that absorb vibrations between the bit and the drill-collars. While the BHA length remains
constant, the drill pipes’ total length may increase as the borehole depth does. The weight exerted
on the bit impacts the cutting process’s performance, measured by the Rate-Of-Penetration (ROP).
The nature of the boundary conditions at the bit–rock interface is a critical aspect of the model
and is discussed in detail below. This mechanical part is combined with a hydraulic system to
maintain the Bottom-Hole Circulating Pressure (BHCP) between pre-specified constraints. Such
a drilling system is schematically pictured in Figure 1.
Moreover, interactions between the drill bit and rock generate significant elastic energy. Understanding these interactions and modeling the seismic radiation patterns are crucial in improving
the drilling performances [? ]. Drill bit-rock interactions generate compressional (P) and vertical
components of shear (SV) waves. These waves propagate through the sub-surface and can reach
the sensing devices (geophones or hydrophones). In onshore environments, geophones record the
particle velocity, and hydrophones, in offshore environments, measure the pressure component. The
drill bit-rock interaction wavefields recorded by the sensors near the surface are known as SWD
data. Drill bit-rock interactions can also generate reflected wavefields that travel through the drill
string. These wavefields can be recorded by accelerometers mounted on top-drive. The accelerometers provide hook-load and hook-speed measurements. The sensing tools give vital information
about the sub-surface, which helps us efficiently model the drill string dynamics.

3. Drill-string model
180

In this section, we present a model that describes the mechanical dynamics of the drill-string.
This model is similar to the one presented in [? ] and is inspired by [? ? ]. A flowchart of the
mathematical representation of the system is given in Figure 5 at the end of the section.
3.1. Distributed Axial dynamics of the drill-string
We model the dynamics of a directional drilling system of length L (Figure 2). In this model,
x denotes the curvilinear abscissa, x = 0 is the top-drive position, and x = L is the position of the
drill bit. We denote φ(x) the well’s inclination at the position x. Let us denote ξ(t, x) the axial
displacement of the drill-string. It is a function of (t, x) evolving in {(t, x) | 0 < t < T, x ∈ [0, L]}
(where T is a positive time). The axial force associated to ξ can be found from the strain, given
as the local relative compression:
w(t, x) = AE

These states are pictured in Figure 2. The ratio diameter/length of a drillstring, typically less
than 10−4 , implies that the drillstring can be modeled using an Euler–Bernoulli beam model.
More precisely, using the distributed model given in [? ? ], we can derive the dynamics of interest

acceleration of gravity acting on the submerged weight ρ̄. It is a simple (but still realistic and
consistent) model for the gravitational force. We neglect for the moment the friction between
the drill-string and the borehole. From (2), we have that the axial force and velocity satisfy the

The topside weight on the drill-string, w(t, 0), corresponds to the system actuation. The downhole
boundary condition at x = L is obtained from a force balance on the lumped Bottom-Hole Assembly
(BHA). These two boundary conditions will be introduced below. Model (3)-(4) does not consider
the Coulomb friction between the drill string and the borehole, also known as the side force.
It has been shown in [? ] that for torsional oscillations, the normal component of this Coulomb
friction term (usually modeled using a differential inclusion) can have significant effects on stability,
even when the bit is off-bottom since it can be a source of stick-slip. Consequently, the axial
components of such Coulomb non-linear friction terms may also have a non-negligible effect on the
dynamics (even if this has not been broadly studied in the literature). We choose not to include this
differential inclusion into our model to simplify the design of our different algorithms. However, we
will show in Section 7.1 that our procedures can be extended in the presence of such a non-linear
term. Note that the proposed model has been extensively analyzed in [? ? ]. All the trends
predicted by the models are supported by field measurements [? ]. Moreover, validation against
field data (at least for the torsional part of the model) has been proposed in [? ].
3.2. Discontinuities of a multiple sectioned drill-string
The lower part of the drill-string is usually made up of drill collars that may have a great impact
on the global dynamics due to their inertia [? ]. In particular, these pipes may have different
lengths, density, inertia or Young’s modulus. This change of the characteristic line impedance may
cause reflections in the traveling waves. Let us assume we have N different sections (N ∈ N), and
let us denote xi the spatial coordinate of the junction point between the (i − 1)th -section and the
ith -section. Let us denote x1 = 0, xN +1 = L and (wi (t, x), v i (t, x)) the force and velocity along the
ith section of the drill-string. The corresponding physical parameters will also be expressed using
the superscript i (for instance ρi will be the density of the ith section). The boundary conditions
at the transition are given by the following continuity constraints
v i (t, xi+1 ) = v i+1 (t, xi+1 ),

wi (t, xi+1 ) = wi+1 (t, xi+1 ).

When there is no ambiguity, this superscript will be omitted to ease the notations.

and harder formations (b) (Source: Adapted from [?

3.3. Topside boundary condition
The drill-string is connected at the top to the top-drive suspended over the drill floor by
the traveling block. Several drill lines connect this block, with one attached to the deadline anchor
and the other being spooled on a drum controlled by AC induction motors [? ]. Thus, we can
consider that the operator controls the weight on the drill-string w0 (t) = w(t, 0). This yields

where w0 is considered as a (known) input.
3.4. Downhole boundary condition: bit-rock interaction
In this section, we compute the downhole boundary condition. As the length of the BHA
(≈ 200m) is much smaller than the one of the drill-string (≈ 2000m), its effect can be lumped into
an ODE coupled with the drill-string [? ? ]. Thus, the downhole boundary condition at x = L
can be obtained from a force balance on the lumped BHA. This yields
Mb

(7)

where Mb is the mass of the lumped BHA and wb (·, ·) the force acting from the rock on the BHA
through the drilling bit, known as the weight on bit (WOB).
This force balance requires the expression of the WOB. We consider a roller-cone bit. To
express the bit-rock interface laws, we can follow the approach developed in [? ] for drag bits
(consistent with laboratory results). As suggested in [? ], the tool’s action is decomposed into
three independent processes: a pure cutting process taking place ahead of the cutting face, a pure
indentation process, and a frictional contact process mobilized along with the interface between

the wear flat and the rock. Integrating the effects of all the individual cutters, the weight-on-bit
wb can be decomposed into a contribution associated with the forces transmitted by the cutting
face of each cutter (wc ), a contribution corresponding to the indentation process (wi ) and another
corresponding to the forces acting on the cutter wear flats (wf ). In what follows, we choose to
include the contribution wi into wf since both are constant. These two forces are pictured in
Figure 4. Following the approach elaborated within the context of PDC bits [? ? ], the cutting
process is split into three successive regimes. A frictional contact process dominates the first phase
(Phase I) due to bit dullness. During the second phase (Phase II), contact forces are fully mobilized,
and additional forces contribute to cutting. Finally, during the last phase (Phase III), the frictional
contact forces increase due to insufficient hole cleaning. Ideally, drilling should be performed to the
foundering point (Phase II/III transition). As shown in [? ], the expression of the WOB depends
on the phase. We will assume that we are in Phase II (cutting phase) and that the depth of cut
is greater than the combined depth of cut at Phase II/III transition. Consequently, the WOB is
expressed as
wb (v(t, L), w(t, L)) = wf + wc = wf + Kd(t) = wf + aζd(t),

(8)

where wf is a friction weight independent of the bit velocity (and therefore constant) while K = aζ,
with a being the bit radius, ζ a characterization of the cutting angle and  the intrinsic specific
energy of the rock [? ? ]. The function d(t) is the combined depth of cut per revolution [? ? ? ].
It satisfies the following equation,

d(t) =

where the bit angular velocity ωbit is assumed known here. We have previously presented a fully
validated torsional model to estimate ωbit which may be integrated into the present here through a
coupling at the drill-bit [? ]. More details about axial-torsional couplings are given in Section 7.2.
Experimental evidence for the proposed expression of the weight-on-bit (equation (8)) for drag bits
have been obtained with a small drilling machine in [? ]. For a roller-cone bit, such an expression
has been validated in [? ] with series of laboratory tests at atmospheric pressure conducted with
an in-house designed drilling rig together with published experimental data.
Thus, the boundary condition (7) rewrites as

3.5. Problem under consideration
The present paper’s objective is to provide a near real-time estimation of the nature of the
drilled rock, i.e., intrinsic energy  or seismic velocity, to improve drill-string dynamics estimation.
10

To properly model the drill-string dynamics, we need to know the seismic velocity of the drilled
rocks. However, before drilling, the seismic velocities provided by surface seismic processing may
be inaccurate. Here, we extend the results of [? ] to the case of a non-vertical multi-sectionals
drill-string. Moreover, we present two new algorithms for estimating the seismic velocities of rocks.
The developed algorithms only require knowledge of the physical properties of the drilling system:
1. The first algorithm uses seismic-while-drilling measurements and extends the methodology
of [? ]. In this procedure, we first express the force exerted on the bit as a function of
the (measured) top-drive force and velocity without depending on the downhole boundary
condition or on the subsurface. We estimate the rock’s seismic velocity by combining this
expression with the knowledge of far-field radial and angular displacements (obtained by
using seismic sensors).
2. The second algorithm directly uses the boundary condition (9). We express the force exerted
on the bit and the corresponding velocity as functions of the (measured) top-drive force and
velocity. Then, we apply signal filtering and parameters estimation techniques to equation
(9) to obtain the intrinsic specific energy of the rock.
3. The last algorithm is based on a machine learning approach. Applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the measured outputs (top-drive force and velocity) and choosing relevant
attributes such as the dominant frequencies and their corresponding gains. Then, by pairing
the relevant attributes to their corresponding , we run a neural network learning algorithm
to train the model. The training is done with a set of thousand simulations for which the
parameters of interest are modified between each run.
Also, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each procedure. Moreover, we show how the
proposed algorithms can be extended in the presence of non-linear Coulomb friction terms (see
Section 7.1) and to systems with coupled axial-torsional oscillations (see Section 7.2).
4. Expression of the drill-bit axial force and velocity

245

250

Among the three algorithms we introduce in this paper, two of them require the knowledge of
the axial force and velocity exerted at the drill-bit. It has been shown in [? ] that it is possible (for
a vertical uni-sectional well) to express the drill-bit source signature as a function of top-drive force
and velocity measurements. The proposed method was based on the Riemann invariants and the
backstepping methodology. Here, we extend the results of [? ] to the case of our multi-sectional
non-vertical well.
4.1. Derivation of Riemann invariants
The Riemann invariants of a hyperbolic PDE are the states corresponding to a transformation
of the system which has a diagonalized transport matrix, i.e. the system can be written as a series
of transport equations only coupled through the source terms [? ]. On the set {(t, x)| 0 < t <
T, x ∈ [xi , xi+1 ]}, we define the Riemann invariants as

4.2. Delayed equations
In this section, we adjust the ideas of [? ] to the case of our non-vertical well with multiple
connections. The objective is to express our PDEs system as delayed equations. Such a delay
approach is particularly suitable for this kind of systems due to the transport structure. It allows using the wide range of tools already developed for time-delay systems. Let us consider the
extension for the backstepping Volterra transformation [? ? ] that has been introduced in [? ]

where the kernels Kiuu , Kizu , Kiuz and Kizz are continuous functions defined on the domain Ti =
{(x, y) ∈ [xi , xi+1 ]2 , y ≤ x}. They satisfy a set of PDEs (that admits a unique solution) that is
given in [? ] (replacing 0 by xi ). Note that theses kernels can be explicitly computed following the
approach given in [? ].
Differentiating (20)-(21) with respect to time and space and integrating by parts, one can show
that the states αi and β i satisfy the following set of transport PDEs

4.3. Expression of the downhole velocity and force

260

Equations (26) and (27) allow us to compute the velocity and the force at the point x = xi+1
simply knowing past and futures values of these states at the point x = xi . Using the continuity of
the force and velocity at each junction, we can iterate the procedure and consequently express the
downhole velocity and force as
of past and futures values of the topside states (the total

well, this corresponds to [? , Equation (49)]. It is interesting to note that such an expression does
not directly depend on the downhole boundary condition. It is now possible to use the drill-bit
source signature to estimate the nature of the drilled rock.
5. Estimation of the specific intrinsic energy 

270

275

The intrinsic specific energy refers to the amount of energy required to cut a unit volume of
rock. This value is dependent on cutter geometry, depth of cut, and rock. However, similar to
scratch test studies in rock mechanics, we assume that the specific intrinsic energy is a constant
quantity characterizing a particular combination of cutter geometry and rock. This section presents
three different algorithms to estimate the parameter  and discuss their respective advantages and
drawbacks. Two of these procedures require the knowledge of the drill-bit source signature. We
use the drill-bit source signature estimation methodology in these algorithms, which is presented
in the previous section. The different algorithms are summarized by Algorithms 1, 2 and 3 .
5.1. Wavelet-based approaches
The two first algorithms we present are based on the knowledge of the drill-bit source signature.
The first one combines the drill-bit force and velocity estimation with Seismic While Drilling
techniques, while the second one estimates the parameter  directly from the model.
14

5.1.1. Seismic While Drilling estimation (Algo. 1)
This section shows how to estimate intrinsic specific energy for different rocks using seismicwhile-drilling (SWD) data. Richard and Dagrain [? ], by using different rock types, study the
relationship between the parameter  and the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS). They show
that by expressing the  as stress rather than energy, the parameter  is correlated with UCS
(M P a) ≈ U CS(M P a).

(29)

Several recent works aim to relate the rock strength to the seismic velocity of primary wave [?
]. For example, by comprehensive analysis of different rock types, ranging from sedimentary to
metamorphic, Sharma and Singh [? ] show that the seismic velocity of the primary wave and UCS
are linearly correlated, and the relationship is as follows
U CS = 0.0642Vp − 117.99,

(30)

where Vp (m/s) is the seismic velocity of the primary wave. This relationship is derived based on
linear regression, and a strong correlation of R2 = 0.9022 is reported. By plugging equation (30)
into equation (29), we get
 ≈ 0.0642Vp − 117.99.
(31)
280

285

290

Hence, by knowing the rock’s seismic velocity that the system is drilling into, the estimation of 
is possible. Next, we show how to estimate the velocities of rocks while drilling.
SWD measurements record the radiated elastic energy from the drill-bit rock interaction that
is traveled through the earth’s structure. For example, variations in the amplitude of P-waves and
S-waves’ direct arrivals in the processed SWD measurements, after removing the source signature,
reflect the changes in the rock properties near the drill-bit. In other words, changes in the energy
of P-waves and S-waves’ direct arrivals can imply that the bit is turning right and that the well’s
trajectory is modified. The direct arrivals can be used in a relative sense to infer the relative
changes in the rock properties such as their seismic velocities or unconstrained rock strengths [? ].
However, Rector and Hardage [? ] show that the radiation patterns of the direct arrivals depend
on the Vp and Vs velocities of the rock interacting with the drill-bit.
In the deviated well with an inclination angle of γ, the radiation pattern for the primary wave
is as follows
A1 cos(φj + γ)
rj
Urj (rj , φj , t) =
ŵ(t − , L),
(32)
2
ρf Vp rj
Vp
where rj is the distance from drill-bit to the j th receiver near the surface, φj is the opening angle
between the drill-bit and j th receiver, measured relative to z axis, γ is an inclination angle of
drill-string, which is measured as a deviation angle with respect to z axis, t is time, L is the
length of drill-string, ρf is the density of the interacting rock with the drill-bit, ŵ = w w is
the auto-correlation of drill-bit source signature, A1 is a constant, and Urj is the far field radial
component of the primary wave radiation pattern recorded by the j th receiver. In most rocks we
have ρf = 1.74Vp0.25 , hence equation (30) simplifies to
Urj (rj , φj , t) =

rj
A1 cos(φj + γ)
ŵ(t − , L).
1.74Vp2.25 rj

(33)

Similarly, the far-field radiation pattern for secondary wave reads
Uφj (rj , φj , t) =

A1 sin(φj + γ)
rj
ŵ(t − , L).

(34)

By matching the direct arrivals of the primary wave in the source compensated SWD data to the
radiation pattern in equation (33), we can estimate the primary velocity of rock interacting with
the drill-bit. However, there are three unknowns in equation (33), i.e., Vp , A1 , and w. Hence, first,
we need to estimate the drill-bit source signature. Using equation (26) and the iterative approach
described in Section 4.3, we can consider as available the (delayed) values of the downhole force,
i.e., drill-bit source signature. Now that we have the estimate of the drill-bit source signature w,
the only unknowns in equation (33) are the scaling factor A1 , and the primary velocity of rock Vp .
The cross-correlation of the estimated source signature with the SWD data gives the primary and
secondary direct arrivals. By least-squares matching of the primary direct arrivals in the source
compensated SWD data, Urobs
(rj , φj , t), with the radiation pattern represented in equation (33)
j
and after plugging the auto-correlation of the estimated source signature, we estimate the primary
wave velocity of the rock by minimizing the following cost function

where Urcal
is the radiation pattern of primary wave estimated by using equation (33), N is the
j
number of time samples in the data, and M is the number of receivers or channels that are
recoding the SWD data. Equation (35) is solved by the least-squares matching method. Finally,
after estimating the primary wave velocity of rock, we estimate  using (31).
After solving for Vp , we can also apply the same procedure to estimate the secondary velocity
of rocks Vs . To do so, we minimize
Vˆs = argmin

Equation (36) is solved by the least-squares matching method, as well. Note that, after solving
equation (35), the values of Vp , and A1 are known. So, by plugging the estimates of Vp , A1 , and
the auto-correlation of drill-bit source signature into the cost function of equation (36), the only
V
un-known is Vs . By having the estimates of Vp , and Vs , the Vps ratio can be further used to identify
reservoir fluids [? ]. The algorithm is described by Algorithm 1. Although this algorithm requires
several seismic sensors, the corresponding advantage is an increased robustness.
5.1.2. Direct estimation from equation (9) (Algo. 2)
The specific intrinsic energy of the rock naturally appears in equation (9). Using equations (26)(27) and the iterative approach described in Section 4.3, we can consider as available the (delayed)
2
values of the downhole force and velocity. Regarding the term ∂∂t2ξ (t, L) (that corresponds to
∂v
∂t (t, L)) that appears in equation (9), we can obtain it by differentiating the estimated downhole
velocity v(t, L). Of course, the corresponding signals should be low-pass filtered to minimize the
negative effects of the boosted high frequency noise. Equation (9) rewrites as
ψ(t) = φ(t) + C,

Note that the term C is potentially unknown (due to the term wf ). Then, it becomes possible to
use parameter estimation techniques (such as Recursive Least Squares) to estimate the unknown

where φ̂ and ψ̂ are the estimations of the functions φ and ψ obtained using the iterative approach
described in Section 4.3. It is worth mentioning that with this procedure the gravitational forces
(i.e. the functions Giw and Giz that appear in equations (26) and (27)) do not actually need to be
estimated since these constant terms could be embedded into the term C. The main advantage
of this approach is that it is easy to implement and only requires top-drive measurements and
the knowledge of the different physical parameters of the well. However, such a procedure may
be sensitive to noise or to sensor defaults. To reduce the noise negative effects, we can filter the
measured signals with a low-pass filter (Butterworth filter for instance). Finally, this procedure
strongly depends on the accuracy of our model to describe the bit-rock interaction. The algorithm
is summarized by Algorithm 2
5.2. Machine Learning estimation (Algo. 3)
The last procedure we present in this paper is based on Machine Learning ([? ]). It does not
require any specific knowledge of the system (no model is needed). Machine learning algorithms
have already be used in control applications in [? ] or in [? ], using adaptive neural networks.
Since the measured outputs (top-drive force and velocity) somehow depend on the rock’s intrinsic

specific energy, their spectrum should contain sufficient information to distinguish the drilled rock’s
nature. By applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the measured outputs (top-drive force
and velocity), we can obtain these signals’ spectra. More precisely, let us denote y(t) the measured
continuous output. In practice, this signal is not continuous but sampled (with a sampling rate
that depends on our sensors’ quality). Let us denote Y, the vector obtained by concatenation of
all our measurements. Let us assume Y has N components (i.e., we have N measurements). Its
discrete Fourier transform Ŷ is a vector with N components defined by
Ŷ (k) =

The vector Ŷ is a complex function that corresponds to the spectrum of the signal y. Several
attributes characterize it. Among them, we can cite the dominant peak (highest value of the
modulus of Ŷ ), the number of peaks, and the corresponding frequencies. The values of these
attributes are somehow related to the value of . For a set of known physical parameters that
characterize the well (including its geometry), we can run thousands of simulations, only modifying
the unknown parameters (i.e.,  but also the potentially unknown friction weight) between each
simulation. From this data set, for which the correct values of  are known (since these data
are simulated), similar to what is done by the human brain (experience), the machine learning
algorithm will learn and find the suitable correlations between the previously defined attributes
and the unknown parameter . Once adequately trained, the machine learning algorithm can then
be applied to make predictions for new data sets (for which the parameter  is unknown).
To solve this regression problem and correctly predict the parameter , we choose to use a neural
network algorithm. This kind of Machine Learning algorithm is efficient and easy to implement [?
]. Such a network consists of different connected nodes (that model the neurons of a real brain)
called artificial neurons. Each neuron receives different inputs and produces a single output that
can be sent to other neurons. The output of each neuron is obtained by applying an activation
function to a weighted sum of the inputs. This activation function is usually non-linear. Among the
most commonly used activation functions, we can cite the Sigmoid function or the tanh function.
More details on how to choose the activation function or the weight can be found in [? ? ]. A
neural network can have several layers. The input of the first layers corresponds to the attributes
we have chosen (in our case, the attributes that characterize the spectrum of the top-drive force and
velocity), while the inputs for the next layers correspond to the neurons’ outputs in the previous
18

335

340

345

355

layer. The global output of the neural network is the predicted value of .
To train the network, we first simulate thousands of test points for which we know the correct
output and measure the corresponding top-drive velocity. We generate the spectrum of the topdrive velocity signal for each simulation and choose a set of relevant features (such as the dominant
peak, the corresponding frequency) that will constitute our dataset. While training our neural
network, it appeared that the relevant attributes for learning are the two dominant gains (and
their corresponding frequencies) of the top-drive velocity spectrum. This dataset is divided into
two sets: the training set and the testing set. We first construct the network (i.e., we choose the
number of neurons, layers, weights) and train it on the training set. We then test its performance on
the testing set by computing the mean squared error between the real values of  and the predicted
ones. We repeat the procedure, changing the network’s parameters and mixing the training and
testing set (cross-validation). Finally, we choose the best network (i.e., the one for which the error
is minimum) and train the algorithm with the data available. Our algorithm can then be used on
unknown datasets.
Such a neural network algorithm is fast, reliable, and easy to implement. However, the main
drawback is that it requires many data (i.e., number of simulations) to train the algorithm. Moreover, changing the physical parameters or the well’s geometry implies training the algorithm again
with a new set of data. The algorithm may also depend on the system’s initial condition and the
input (although this is not a real problem since we can always consider a rest state and the same
input to estimate ). A solution to increase the robustness could be to include these parameters
into the neural network at the cost of producing a higher number of training points. Another
approach to improving the trained model’s generalizability is to use transfer learning concepts [?
? ? ]. The details of the algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 3.

we evaluate the quality of the weight-on-bit estimations and the bit velocity provided by equations
(26) and (27) in the presence of noisy measurements. Then, we will compare the efficiency of our
three algorithms in estimating the nature of the rock interacting with the drill-bit.

wave equation is transformed into transport equations discretized using a first-order upwind scheme.
This choice is made to ensure numerical robustness and avoid spurious oscillations, as higherorder schemes perform poorly due to the temporal discontinuities introduced by the distributed
differential inclusions used to represent the Coulomb friction. To guarantee numerical accuracy, we
choose a sufficiently fine spatial grid. This is an amenable approach since the simulation speed is
not of critical importance for the present analysis (only the computational efforts of the estimation
algorithms matter). In all simulations, a spatial grid of 500 cells is used for the drill string. We
choose the time-step such that the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition [? ] is satisfied. All
the simulations are done using MATLAB except the neural network algorithm that is performed
using Python.
6.1. Estimation of the drill-bit source
In this section we evaluate the quality of the estimations of the weight-on-bit and of the bit
velocity. The drill-bit is interacting with unconsolidated sands (i.e. water saturated) for which

and (27). The kernels K are computed using the method of characteristics and a fixed point
algorithm (see [? ] for details). The different integrals are computed using a trapezoidal method
with adjustable precision. We consider the case of noisy measurements. We model the noise by a
white Gaussian noise that is characterized by its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As it is done in [? ],
the SNR is defined as

the length of the pipe-section). To reduce the effect of the noise we use a second order Butterworth

of the computations can be done off-line (computation of the backstepping kernels for instance),
and the real computational time is around 20s to estimate on a 20s time-window. This makes the
current code amenable for real implementation, although in that case complexity of the algorithm
should also be considered. Note that the computational burden can be reduced by using a less
time-consuming algorithm to compute the different integral terms or by decreasing the space-step
(at the cost of a lower accuracy).
As is done in [? ? ] we introduce the quality of the reconstruction metric for the estimated forceon-bit. This will help us to examine the performance of the proposed method. A similar verification

where arms is the root-mean-square amplitude of the noise-free signal, and σn2 is the variance of
the noise. Choosing a value for the SNR gives the corresponding amplitude for the white Gaussian
noise. Note that the value of the SNR may be different for the velocity and force measurements.
We compare the real force-on-bit with our estimation in Figure 7. The comparison between the
real axial bit velocity and the estimated one is done in Figure 8. The SNR is equal to 10. The

SNR of top-drive velocity and the top-drive force (the SNR being chosen between 1 and 15). We
have also plotted a dashed line that corresponds to the limit value of Q = 10. We can observe
a symmetrical effect between the SNR of top-drive velocity and the SNR of top-drive force. The
critical value of Q = 10 is not reached for low SNR values (SN R < 2). In our simulations, we
find that when the quality factor is larger than 10, the rock intrinsic energy estimation algorithms
result in satisfactory performances.

6.2. Estimation of the rock interacting with the drill-bit
We now use our three algorithms to estimate the nature of the rock interacting with the drillbit. The efficiency of the different algorithms are compared for three different types of rocks that
have different hardness (i.e., different compressional and shear velocities)
• Unconsolidated sands (i.e. water saturated) for which Vp = 2000 m/s, Vs = 1150 m/s, ρf = 2

• Sedimentary rocks (e.g. sandstone) for which Vp = 2710 m/s, Vs = 1500 m/s, ρf = 2.2
g/cm3 and  = 57 J/cm3 .
• Igneous or metamorphic rocks (e.g. granite) for which Vp = 4610 m/s Vs = 2700 m/s,
ρf = 2.7 g/cm3 and  = 175 J/cm3 .

6.2.1. Seismic While Drilling Algorithm
We use our first algorithm (SWD Algorithm) to estimate the rocks’ velocity that are interacting
with the drill-bit. We consider that 100 seismic sensors are available (50 on each side of the drillstring). The distance between each receiver is equal to 25 meters. Note that this distribution may
not be optimal due to the bit’s final orientation (which is equal to 60 degrees according to Figure 6).
Using the simulated weight-on-bit and the (known) value of Vp , we compute the radiation patterns
for each sensor to which we add noise with SNR equal to 5. Moreover, by using the top-drive force
and velocity measurements, which are given by the PDE simulation, we estimate the weight-on-bit,
and consequently, it becomes possible to apply Algorithm 1. For the three different rocks, we have
performed 75 simulations and compute the corresponding  using such a procedure. We have given
in Table 3 the value of the mean and the standard deviation of our estimations. One can notice
that the estimations are almost equal to the real values even in the presence of significant noise.
Moreover, the standard deviation remains extremely low. This underlines the robustness of the
proposed approach that uses a large number of sensors. For one testing point, Algorithm 1 runs
in 0.06s.
6.2.2. Direct Estimation Algorithm
Let us now estimate  using Algorithm 2. The results are shown in Table 3. We have assumed
that the constant C that appears in (39) is not known. One can notice that the estimations are
close to the real data (even if, due to the important noise (SNR equal to 5), the standard deviation
may be important. However, one must keep in mind that such an approach is hugely dependent on
the model we have for the downhole boundary condition. The computational time to run Algorithm
2 on one testing point is of 0.01s.
6.2.3. Machine Learning Algorithm
We now design our machine learning algorithm. As explained in Section 5.2 and Algorithm 3,
we first train our algorithm on a set of data made of 10000 simulations for which only the values of
 and wf change between each simulation. An example of a power spectrum of top-drive velocity,
for the case  = 11, is given in Figure 11. Note that the spectrum has been normalized by its
maximum gain and that a saturation has been set at −20dB.
To run our neural network, we have used Python’s algorithm sklearn.neural network.MLPRegressor
with 50 hidden layers, a BFGS solver for weight optimization, and an adaptive learning rate. Again,
the results are shown in Table 3. One can notice that these predictions are close to the real values

rocks) than the one we obtained using the two other algorithms. The computational time to train
the network is 140s while the time required to run the algorithm on one testing point is 0.01s.
6.2.4. Comparison between the different algorithms
The three different algorithms provide satisfying and reliable estimation for the rock’s intrinsic
specific energy in the presence of important noises. However, the SWD algorithm presents an
impressively high accuracy with a low standard deviation. This is related to its inherent robustness
properties due to the use of a large number of sensors. Moreover, the estimation procedure is simple
and can be easily adjusted for new constant physical parameters. The second algorithm also gives
reliable estimates (at least for low values of ). However, one must be aware that this algorithm
requires a reliable model for the downhole condition (bit rock-interaction). Finally, even if the
Machine Learning algorithm shows satisfactory performance, it requires important datasets to be
run, which can be time-consuming. Note that another drawback of our ML procedure is that the
available data currently comes from simulations, which implies a model dependency (although it
is not as crucial as for the second procedure). However, such a Machine Learning algorithm is
easy to implement and fast to run once adequately trained. Moreover, it is not sensitive to the
discretization step since it only uses top-drive measurements.

We now compare the robustness properties of the different algorithms concerning uncertainties
on the different physical parameters. More precisely, we address the effects of mismatch between
the physical and mathematically modeled drill string dynamics (especially, errors in downhole
boundary condition: bit-rock interaction modeling) on the three algorithms’ performances. Adding
discrepancies to the modeling will introduce errors in estimating the force-on-bit but not the
measured hook-load, hook-speed, and SWD measurements. Hence, in the SWD algorithm, an
incorrect source will be correlated with the data. In the direct estimation algorithm, the effect
of incorrect bit-rock interaction coefficients will be added to a wrong estimation of the force-onbit. Finally, the machine learning algorithm will be trained with the wrong model. The proposed
analysis is the first step towards a complete sensitivity analysis (that would be outside the scope
of this paper). In what follows, we consider that all the physical parameters used to simulate
the drilling system (e.g., inertia, inclination, length, mass) are subject to a random uncertainty
(bounded by a maximum percentage d). We have pictured in Figure 12 the comparison between
the simulated force-on bit and the estimated one in the absence of noise but in the presence of a
discrepancy of 10% between the physical parameters used for the simulation and those used for
the simulation. Note that for this simulation, all the uncertainties have been set to the maximum
bound of 10%. As expected, there is a mismatch between the estimated force and the simulated one
(around 15 %). Note that the phase of the function is barely changed. We now compare our three
algorithms’ performance in the presence of uncertainties on the different parameters. We consider
the case of sedimentary rock for which  = 57. We have performed 75 simulations for which there
is a discrepancy up to d% between the parameters used for the estimation (and for the training of
the last algorithm) and the real ones. We have given in Table 4 the values of the mean and the
standard deviation of our estimations for different maximal bound d (10%, 20% and 30%). We have
used an SNR of 10 for all the measured signals. All three algorithms provide relevant estimations
even in the presence of important uncertainties. The machine learning algorithm seems to be
the most accurate but suffers from an important standard deviation. A similar dispersion of the
estimations can be observed for the direct estimation algorithm. This is not surprising since these
two algorithms are trained on a false model. Conversely, the SWD algorithm gives an accurate
estimation with a relatively low standard deviation. We can explain these good performances by
the fact that the uncertainties barely affect the phase of the estimated force-on-bit. As the phase is
the most important attribute when correlating the estimated force with SWD measurements, this
results in better estimation and a lower standard deviation. This emphasizes the robustness of such
an approach even if this is done at the cost of an important number of sensors. That said, the SWD
method (i.e., Algorithm 1) is an alternating minimization method, which requires proper initial
estimation of the formation velocity. In Algorithm 1, we use the time delay between the recorded
data near the surface and the calculated force-on-bit (source signature) at the bit location to provide
an initial estimation of formation velocity, i.e., Vp0 . This method may not always provide a proper
initial estimation of formation velocity. Accordingly, we can take advantage of the direct estimation
and machine learning methods in providing Vp0 necessary in the SWD algorithm. Moreover, in the
SWD algorithm, having access to a proper Vp0 value will improve the robustness and convergence
rate of the SWD algorithm, as well.
7. Extensions
The three algorithms we design in this paper provide an efficient and reliable estimation of
the rock’s nature that is interacting with the drill-bit, enabling a more precise characterization of

the subsurface. However, the proposed axial dynamics given by equations (3)-(4) neglect several
aspects that are crucial to envision real implementation. First, we have neglected the Coulomb
friction between the drill string and the borehole. We have then neglected the torsional dynamics
of the drilling device by assuming that the bit angular velocity was perfectly known. The main
reason behind this choice of an (over)-simplistic model was to facilitate the design of our different
procedures. This section shows how our algorithms can be extended to these more sophisticated
(and realistic) models.
7.1. Non-linear Coulomb friction terms
The proposed (simplified) axial dynamics given by equations (3)-(4) neglect the Coulomb friction between the drill string and the borehole (also known as side force). It has been shown in
[? ], that for torsional oscillations, this Coulomb friction term may have a non-negligible impact
on the dynamics. More precisely, it has a velocity weakening effect that may generate stick-slip
oscillations. As far as we know, the side force effect on the axial motion of the drill-string has
not been studied in the literature. However, it seems reasonable to assume that this force can
be expressed using a similar model as the one used for torsional oscillations, namely a differential
26

inclusion. More precisely, inspired by [? ] we add the term F(t, x) to equation (4) that is a differential inclusion that represents the Coulomb friction between the drill-string and the borehole.
The model we propose uses the following inclusion

a

v(t) > vc ,
F(t, x) = µk FA (x),
a
(44)
F(t, x) ∈ ±µs FA (x),
|v(t)| < vc ,


a
F(t, x) = −µk FA (x),
v(t) < −vc ,
where µas is the static friction coefficient (i.e. the friction between two or more solid objects that
are not moving relative to each other) and µak kinetic friction coefficient (also known as dynamic
friction or sliding friction, which occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other and
rub together), vc is the threshold on the axial velocity where the Coulomb friction transits from
static to dynamic. The function FA is the normalized axial force acting between the drill-string
and the borehole wall. The function F(t, x) ∈ ±µas FA (x) denotes the inclusion where
F(t, x) = −

1 ∂
w(t, x) − kξ v(t, x) ∈ [−µas FA (x), µas FA (x)],
Aρ ∂x

(45)

and takes the boundary values ±µas FA (x) if this relationship does not hold. Let us assume that the
coefficients µas , µak and vc are known as well as the function FA . How to estimate such coefficients
is outside the scope of this paper, but when the bit is off-bottom, adaptive observers can be
designed following the procedure detailed in [? ]. When all the points of the drill-string reach the
kinematic mode, then the function F(t, x) does not (directly) depend on time anymore since we
have F(t, x) = ±µak FA (x). Thus, this term can be added to the function h in (4) and the previous
computations can be still be applied to compute the downhole force and velocity as functions of
past and future values of the top-drive states. These estimations only hold if we have |v| > vc
for all drill-string points. Thus, we need to apply our formula to all points (in practice, to a
sufficiently large number of points) of the drill-string to verify that the condition is not violated.
Among all the estimations of the drill-bit source signature, only the ones for which this condition
is fulfilled can be used to estimate the rock’s nature if using Algorithms 1 and 2. Note that using
adequate control laws may enforce the system to remain in a steady-state for which this condition
is always verified. Regarding the machine learning algorithm, it can straightforwardly be adjusted
to deal with this Coulomb friction term. Moreover, by slightly modifying the algorithm, it is also
possible to estimate the friction coefficients µas and µak . We compare the real force-on-bit with our
estimation in Figure 13. The comparison between the real axial bit velocity and the estimated one
is made in Figure 13. The different signals are noise-free. The Coulomb friction parameters are
chosen as follows:
µas = 0.45, µak = 0.28, vc = 0.25.

515

They are assumed to remain the same for the pipe and the collar. One can notice that the downhole
force and velocity estimations remain extremely satisfying except for some time intervals for which
the velocity is lower than vc . This is consistent with our analysis since, in that case, the system
has not broken the static friction limit.
7.2. Torsional motion of the drill-string
This paper focused on the drill-bit’s axial motion and assumed that the bit angular velocity
ωbit was a known positive function. However, the proposed axial dynamics have to be coupled with

a torsional model to obtain an axial-torsional drill-string model. Such a torsional model has been
proposed in [? ] in the case of an off-bottom bit. The equations have the same structure as (3)-(4),
including a non-linear Coulomb friction term similar to (44). Nevertheless, for non-vertical wells,
in the presence of angular and axial movements, the Coulomb friction term couples the angular
and axial dynamics, and equation (44) has to be modified accordingly. Regarding the downhole
boundary conditions (equation (9) and the analogous equation for torque as given in [? ]), as
1
suggested in [? ], the term ωbit
has to replaced by an inclusion (g non-linearity) to deal with small
axial and angular velocities. For torsional oscillations, such a term can be the source of stick-slip
oscillations. The derivation of a complete and validated axial-torsional model is out of the scope of
this paper. However, even if the downhole boundary conditions become more complex, adjusting
the approach presented in Section 4, it becomes possible (eventually including the new Coulomb
side forces) to express the bit torque and angular velocity as delayed and future values of the topdrive states. Indeed, our approach does not require the use of the downhole boundary condition.
Consequently, our first algorithm can still be applied. However, the second algorithm still requires
a good model for the downhole boundary condition. Finally, the machine learning procedure can
still be implemented by including the top-drive torque and angular velocity spectrum.
8. Concluding remarks

540

545

We have developed three different algorithms for a near-real-time estimation of the rock’s intrinsic specific energy interacting with the drill-bit. We have considered a multi-sectional directional
well. The algorithms only use surface measurements and do not depend on any explicit knowledge about the subsurface properties. The algorithms were based on seismic-while-drilling, direct
parameter estimation, and machine learning. They provided an efficient and reliable framework
for estimating the nature of rocks interacting with the drill-bit, enabling a subsurface’s practical
characterization. We have discussed the advantages and drawbacks of each approach. Among
our three algorithms, the model-based estimation algorithm (Algorithm 2) provides accurate estimations. However, this algorithm requires a reliable model for the downhole condition and, in
that sense, is extremely model-dependent. It is easy to implement and present satisfying robust28

550

ness properties regarding the SWD procedure due to the available multiple seismic sensors. The
Machine Learning algorithm is also easy to implement and fast to run once properly trained but
may not be robust to changes in the system parameters (as a new long training phase would be
necessary). We have shown that the proposed methodologies can be applied to drilling systems in
the presence of non-linear Coulomb friction terms and coupled axial-torsional oscillations of the
drill string. Theoretically, the proposed estimations can be coupled with existing observers and
controllers to improve the drilling performances by reducing non-productive time, increasing the
ROP, and reducing the effect of undesired torsional oscillations. This is an important step towards a
subsurface-aware drilling system. Even though the proposed approach is a necessary and significant
step in incorporating formation information and sensing in drill string dynamics estimation, our
future interest entails adding more complexities into the modeling system (by combining torsional
and axial dynamics), generalizing the machine learning mapping operator, designing formationaware observers for optimal controlling of drill string dynamics, and validating the algorithms in
field trail.

presence of the functions h3 and h4 (since the well is not vertical). The transformation (20)-(21)
being a Volterra transformation, it is invertible [? ]. The inverse transformation is defined by
