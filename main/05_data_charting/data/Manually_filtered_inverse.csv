The problems are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwell's equations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due to the ill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues, recent studies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings from measurements to the property directly. In this paper, we show that such a mapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not wide) network with only five layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of an intriguing property: a near-linear relationship between the input and output, after applying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when dealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by a wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are linearly correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels. Furthermore, this property can be easily turned into a light-weight encoder-decoder network for inversion. The encoder contains the integration of seismic data and the linear transformation without need for fine-tuning. The decoder only consists of a single transformer block to reverse the integral of velocity. Experiments show that this interesting property holds for two geophysics inversion problems over four different datasets. Compared to much deeper InversionNet, our method achieves comparable accuracy, but consumes significantly fewer parameters.","2022-01-01","2024-09-04 23:15:59","2024-11-27 16:05:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Cited by - 2 - Preprint - 6 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GW5QZ4T8\Feng et al. - 2022 - An Intriguing Property of Geophysics Inversion.pdf","","Geophysical Imaging; Geophysical Inversion; Inverse Problems; Inversion; Seismic Waveform Inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two synthetic datasets and a field dataset.","2024-03-26","2024-09-04 19:44:37","2024-11-27 16:05:02","2024-09-04 19:44:37","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Cited by - 0 - Preprint - 10 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GRELKJQF\Alfarhan et al. - 2024 - Robust Full Waveform Inversion with deep Hessian d.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\HAASCAUN\2403.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2403.17518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly problematic for full waveform inversion, which typically involves numerous runs of the forward process. In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer. In leveraging automatic differentiation, the proposed method can serve as an alternative to the adjoint-state approach for 3D full-waveform inversion, reducing the computation time by a factor of 350.","2023-11-16","2024-09-04 19:52:43","2024-11-27 16:04:26","2024-09-04 19:52:43","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Cited by - 1 - Preprint - 21 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3ZLHGKCL\Zou et al. - 2023 - Deep Neural Helmholtz Operators for 3D Elastic Wav.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GRW58A47\2311.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2311.09608","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations.

This modeling is based upon a wave equation and it depends on a set of parameters of the subsurface. Recent studies have demonstrated that deep learning methods can be trained with seismic data to estimate velocity models that give a representation of the subsurface where the seismic data was generated. Thus, an analysis is made on the impact that different sets of parameters have on the estimation of velocity models by a fully convolutional network (FCN). The experiments varied the number of sources among four options (1, 10, 25 or 50 shots) and used three different ranges of peak frequencies: 4, 8 and 16 Hz. The results demonstrated that, although the number of sources have more influence on the computational time needed to train the FCN than the peak frequency, both changes have significant impact on the quality of the estimation. The best estimations were obtained with the experiment of 25 sources with 4 Hz and increasing the peak frequency to 8 Hz improved even more the results, especially regarding the FCN's loss function. © 2019 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.","2019","2024-08-24 17:43:28","2024-11-27 15:53:33","","93-98","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 0 - 92 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\IXSPFKK9\Campos et al. - 2019 - An empirical analysis of the influence of seismic .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\33PPBUTQ\display.html","","","Deep Learning; Fully Convolutional Networks; Geophysics; Seismic Data Analysis; Velocity Model Estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WMSCI 2019 - 23rd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images. We show by numerical experimentation that the surrogate model can reproduce the seismic images accurately, and, more importantly, the uncertainty propagation from the input velocity fields to the image ensemble. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2021","2024-08-24 17:39:18","2024-11-27 15:51:51","","1229-1250","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 5 - 86 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BZ28ARM5\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3LPP73LC\Freitas et al. - 2021 - An encoder-decoder deep surrogate for reverse time.pdf","","","Deep learning; Reverse time migration; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, the autoencoder (AE) is a typical unsupervised learning network, whose basic principle is to compress the input seismic data for their intrinsic features in the latent space with an encoder and, thereafter, to decipher these features for seismic profiles as the output with a decoder. This process is fully automatic with high stability and is not very sensitive to data quality. In this article, we propose an elastic WT inversion algorithm based on the AE method (AEWT) to invert the P -velocity model. Compared with the standard WT, the AEWT method automatically extracts the intrinsic features of the refractions with AE as reference data for the misfit functionals. Feature images in the latent space show similar but intensified sensitivity to the traveltimes with respect to velocity perturbations. We present one synthetic and two field data tests for comparing the proposed AEWT and the standard WT tomograms to investigate the locations of a buried fault and the depth of a buried sinkhole.

Building on the idea of describing seismic wavefields as a superposition of local plane waves, we propose to interpolate seismic data by using a physics informed neural network (PINN). In the proposed framework, two feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked with reconstructing the seismic data, whereas an auxiliary, smaller network estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (coarsely sampled) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and precomputed local slopes. We find that introducing a second network to estimate the local slopes, whereas at the same time interpolating the aliased data enhances the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the primary network. Moreover, an additional positional encoding layer embedded as the first layer of the wavefield network confers to the network the ability to converge faster, improving the accuracy of the data term. © 2024 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

The drill-string dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks while drilling. By exploiting the derived models’ particular structure, we combine the drill-string dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks’ intrinsic energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis.

Elastic FWI inverts multicomponent data for P and S-wave velocities and densities. We propose an alternative approach for FWI using a combination of machine learning and the physics of wave propagation. Unlike a conventional supervised machine learning, we do not require known answers to train our network. The multicomponent shot gathers are input to a convolutional neural network (CNNs) based auto encoder whose outputs are used as P-wave, S-wave and density models that are used to compute synthetic seismograms using the stress-velocity formulation of the elastic wave equation. The synthetic data are compared against observed input data and the misfit is estimated. The gradient of the misfit with respect to the velocity model parameters is calculated using the adjoint state method. The adjoint state gradient is then used to update the network weights using the automatic differentiation technique. Once the misfit term converges, the neural network can generate subsurface models consistent with the observed data. We observe that the neural network can capture spatial correlations at different scales and thus can introduce regularization in our inverse problem. The regularization is enough to mitigate the cross-talk problem in elastic FWI and also produce good results in areas with low illumination. © 2022 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","2022","2024-08-24 16:22:44","2024-11-27 15:46:51","","882-886","","","2022-August","","","Elastic-AdjointNet","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 8 - 45 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\LNCN8KUD\Dhara y Sen - 2022 - Elastic-AdjointNet A physics guided deep autoenco.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\RTVJQK6I\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the seismic inversion problem based on partial differential wave equations can be addressed using automatic differentiation in the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks, eliminating the need for explicit backpropagating the residual wavefield. However, one challenge that arises in the context of automatic differentiation is the significant memory usage due to the necessity of storing the hidden states of the RNN (i.e., wavefields in seismic modeling) during forward computation for constructing the computational graph and computing the derivatives during backpropagation. This memory overhead can become a bottleneck, particularly when dealing with large-scale inversion problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose an effective boundary-saving strategy that allows for the reconstruction of the computational graph during the backpropagation process. Instead of storing all the intermediate wavefields at each time step, we selectively save the necessary information at the boundaries, thereby significantly reducing the memory footprint. This approach enables us to maintain the convenience and efficiency of automatic differentiation computations while minimizing the memory requirements. Both 2-D and 3-D numerical experiments validate the accurate reconstruction of wavefields with minimal loss in precision, while the computational graph is simultaneously reconstructed. Consequently, the gradients can also be calculated correctly by automatic differentiation with minimal CPU/graphics processing unit (GPU) memory occupation. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","2023","2024-08-24 16:15:49","2024-11-27 15:46:06","","","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 2 - 39 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\I8TEJAKQ\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G3TJ8JSJ\Wang et al. - 2023 - Memory Optimization in RNN-Based Full Waveform Inv.pdf","","","Automatic differentiation; boundary saving; full waveform inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the limited wavefield propagation angle, it is difficult to use one-way wave equation-based migration for high-precision imaging of structures with large inclinations due to issues such as inaccurate amplitudes and migration image artifacts. In addition, when the model has large horizontal velocity differences, it is difficult for the one-way wave propagator to calculate an accurate wavefield phase. Reverse time migration (RTM) based on the two-way wave propagator has a high resolution and avoids the issues associated with one-way wave propagators; however, it has a high computational cost in practical applications. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) application mode that improves one migration method by learning from another one and design a CNN with a structure similar to U-net that combines the advantages of both migration methods. The CNN label is the RTM result, and the corresponding input is the result of one-way wave migration with a generalized screen propagator (GSP). The trained CNN model improves the amplitude in the one-way wave migration image and removes the errors caused by large lateral velocity perturbations. Moreover, by maintaining the high migration calculation efficiency, our CNN model allows for a high resolution, few artifacts, and accurate images of steep structures in the one-way wave migration result. With our method, the accuracy of the one-way wave migration result is close to that of the RTM result.

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-08-24 16:01:33","2024-11-27 15:45:02","","","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 2 - 29 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NU93K4BT\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\42JME73W\Lu y Zhang - 2023 - Seismic Velocity Inversion via Physical Embedding .pdf","","","seismic waveform inversion; causal sequence; physical information neural network; velocity modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the necessity of using large training data and the ‘black box’ nature of learning have limited them in practice and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, including the governing equations and physical facts in such methods is also another challenge, which entails either ignoring the physics or simplifying them using unrealistic data. To address such issues, physics informed machine learning methods have been developed which can integrate the governing physics law into the learning process. In this work, a 1-dimensional (1D) time-dependent seismic wave equation is considered and solved using two methods, namely Gaussian process (GP) and physics informed neural networks. We show that these meshless methods are trained by smaller amount of data and can predict the solution of the equation with even high accuracy. They are also capable of inverting any parameter involved in the governing equation such as wave velocity in our case.

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost. © 2013 IEEE.","2020","2024-08-24 15:57:16","2024-11-27 15:43:59","","112266-112277","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 50 - 24 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KEK5JVDB\Ren et al. - 2020 - A Physics-Based Neural-Network Way to Perform Seis.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\AHE5YR5I\display.html","","","Acoustic wavefield modeling; deep learning inversion; seismic waveform inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a sequence of fast seismic acquisition for dispersion curve extraction and inversion for 3D seismic models, based on wavefield gradiometry, wave equation inversion, and machine-learning technology. The seismic array method that we use is Helmholtz wave equation inversion using measured wavefield gradients, and the dispersion curve inversions are based on a mixture of density neural networks (NNs). For our approach, we assume that a single surface wave mode dominates the data. We derive a nonlinear relationship among the unknown true seismic wave velocities, the measured seismic wave velocities, the interstation spacing, and the noise level in the signal. First with synthetic and then with the field data, we find that this relationship can be solved for unknown true seismic wave velocities using fixed point iterations. To estimate the noise level in the data, we need to assume that the effect of noise varies weakly with the frequency and we need to be able to calibrate the retrieved average dispersion curves with an alternate method (e.g., frequency wavenumber analysis). The method is otherwise self-contained and produces phase velocity estimates with tens of minutes of noise recordings. We use NNs, specifically a mixture density network, to approximate the nonlinear mapping between dispersion curves and their underlying 1D velocity profiles. The networks turn the retrieved dispersion model into a 3D seismic velocity model in a matter of seconds.

This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Training data for deep neural networks is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA.

Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow.

The paper presents a new method to improve the performance of the seismic wave simulation and inversion by integrating the deep learning software platform and deep learning models with the HPC application. The paper has three contributions: 1) Instead of using traditional HPC software, the authors implement the numerical solutions for the wave equation employing recently developed tensor processing capabilities widely used in the deep learning software platform of PyTorch. By using PyTorch, the classical HPC application is reformulated as a deep learning recurrent neural network (RNN) framework; 2) The authors customize the automatic diﬀerentiation of PyTorch to integrate the adjoint state method for an eﬃcient gradient calculation; 3) The authors build a deep learning model to reduce the physical model dimensions to improve the accuracy and performance of seismic inversion. The authors use the automatic diﬀerentiation functionality and a variety of optimizers provided by PyTorch to enhance the performance of the classical HPC application.

Although conventional leakage detection and characterization methods based on time-lapse seismic imaging and inversion generally apply to H2 leakage detection problem, a high-fidelity yet cost effective geophysics approach is still missing to reliably inform leakage location and properties based on very sparse data. In response, we develop a novel supervised machine learning method to detect and characterize H2 leakage from UHS. The input to our neural network are sparse time-lapse seismic waveforms, while the output from the neural network includes the spatial location and physical properties of a H2 leakage. We generate high-quality time-lapse waveforms using the elastic-wave equations to train the neural network. We train and validate our machine learning model and find that it attains high accuracy in using extremely sparse time-lapse seismic data to detect and characterize H2 leakage. Our investigation is the first systematic study that focuses on applying machine learning to subsurface H2 leakage detection and characterization and could potentially serve as a cost-effective geophysical tool for underground hydrogen leakage detection and characterization with high fidelity. © 2024","2024","2024-08-24 16:32:24","2024-11-27 15:30:15","","137-161","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 6 - 48 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\PEPTWCLH\Gao et al. - 2024 - Underground hydrogen storage leakage detection and.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NW5RJ32G\display.html","","","Machine learning; Hydrogen leakage detection; Sparse seismic data; Underground hydrogen storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when multiple parameters are updated simultaneously, the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters will be coupled together, the effect exacerbate the nonlinear problem. We propose a parametric EFWI method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN-EFWI). The parameters that need to be updated are the weights in the neural network rather than the elastic models. The convolutional kernel in the network can increase spatial correlations of elastic models, which can be regard as a regularization strategy to mitigate local minima issue. Furthermore, the representation also can mitigate the cross-talk between parameters due to the reconstruction of Frechét derivatives by neural networks. Both forward and backward processes are implemented using a time-domain finite-difference solver for elastic wave equation. Numerical examples on overthrust models, fluid saturated models and 2004 BP salt body models demonstrate that CNN-EFWI can partially mitigate the local minima problem and reduce the dependence of inversion on the initial models. Mini-batch configuration is used to speed up the update and achieve fast convergence. In addition, the inversion of noisy data further verifies the robustness of CNN-EFWI. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences & Polish Academy of Sciences 2023.","2024","2024-08-24 16:18:29","2024-11-27 15:29:52","","673-687","","2","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 2 - 41 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UAQL325S\Guo et al. - 2024 - Parametric elastic full waveform inversion with co.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3MCSIBKN\display.html","","","Machine learning; Full waveform inversion; Convolutional neural network; Parametric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, conventional rock physics models (RPMs), e.g., the Xu-White model, struggle to accurately obtain the key parameters such as pore aspect ratio in the process of S-wave velocity prediction. This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorporating the decoupled Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is sufficient. In particular, provided a small amount of measured S-wave data (even ten data points), the trained DNN model can also provide reasonable predictions. © 2024","2024","2024-08-24 17:23:49","2024-11-27 15:29:29","","","","","240","","","Shear-wave velocity prediction of tight reservoirs based on poroelasticity theory","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 6 - 73 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\5IRDD93W\Fang et al. - 2024 - Shear-wave velocity prediction of tight reservoirs.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\FFKG4MQ5\display.html","","","Deep neural network; Rock physics model; Shale oil formation; Shear-wave velocity prediction; Wave propagation equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If seismic data lack low frequencies, their resolution deteriorates, leading to inaccurate seismic interpretations. To resolve this problem, we developed a low-frequency reconstruction that employs a modified U-Net neural network. To improve the training of the neural network, we generated training data analogous to unseen data, based on the far-field signature as the wavelet source to retain the spectral characteristics of field data. We addressed potential overfitting by generating a large amount of various synthetic data through wave equation-based modelling using a variety of velocity and density models. After synthesising the seismic data, we implemented a filtering method to produce input data with insufficient low frequencies and label data with sufficient low frequencies. The far-field signature plays an important role in the successful reconstruction of low frequencies due to its intrinsic field data features and greater low-frequency information compared to field data alone. We tested the generalisation of the network using unseen synthetic and field data not used in the training stage, and analyzed the results in the time and frequency domains. Although the input data did not retain frequencies below 10 Hz, the trained network predicted low frequencies that were similar to the desired data. We also produced post-stack sections via simple processing to evaluate low-frequency reconstructions produced by our trained network. The low-frequency reconstruction scheme led to a better understanding of subsurface media. © 2024 Australian Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","2024","2024-08-24 17:14:05","2024-11-27 15:28:50","","263-276","","3","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 0 - 63 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UD3KMQMQ\Park et al. - 2024 - Low-frequency marine seismic data reconstruction b.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UPQSJ3QG\display.html","","","deep learning; Band-limited data; far-field signature; low-frequency reconstruction; modified U-Net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional model-driven full-waveform inversion (FWI) methods, which rely on an initial velocity, suffer from low computational efficiency. Conversely, data-driven deep-learning (DL) approaches heavily rely on extensive training data and lack interpretability due to overreliance on training data for generalization. To address these challenges, we present a seismic velocity inversion network model that incorporates prior knowledge and constraints based on physical laws. The proposed approach involves constructing a data-driven inversion network with dual encoders and single decoder structure, enabling the learning of nonlinear mappings from seismic data to velocity models. By incorporating prior well-logging data and attention mechanisms, the inversion process is improved. In addition, a seismic forward modeling network based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is developed to solve the acoustic wave equation. Leveraging the advantages of parallel computing, the forward modeling process achieves fast calculations. The automatic differentiation algorithm in DL facilitates gradient calculations, specifically back propagation of the residuals to incorporate the physical constraints. Ultimately, the proposed seismic velocity inversion network combines the two network structures while incorporating the constraint of wave field extrapolation law. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this network exhibits advantages in terms of result accuracy and model generalization. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","2024","2024-08-24 16:04:01","2024-11-27 15:25:48","","1-17","","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 0 - 32 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\J4SVBD9J\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\87BEEJGL\Zhang et al. - 2024 - Seismic Velocity Inversion Based on Physically Con.pdf","","","Attention mechanism; physical constraints; prior logging; recurrent neural network (RNN); velocity inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
