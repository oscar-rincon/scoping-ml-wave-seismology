Shear-wave velocity prediction of tight reservoirs based on poroelasticity theory: A comparative study of deep neural network and rock physics model
The absence of shear-wave (S-wave) velocity in well log data limits the effective seismic characterization of lithology, petrophysical properties, and fluid distribution of tight reservoirs in the Chang 7 shale oil formations of Ordos Basin, west China. However, conventional rock physics models (RPMs), e.g., the Xu-White model, struggle to accurately obtain the key parameters such as pore aspect ratio in the process of S-wave velocity prediction. This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorporating the decoupled Kuster-Tokso ̈z (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is sufficient. In particular, provided a small amount of measured S-wave data (even ten data points), the trained DNN model can also provide reasonable predictions.
