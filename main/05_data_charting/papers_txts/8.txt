Abstract
A new cost-effective surrogate model using deep neural network (DNN) for seismic wave propagation in rocks saturated
with fluid is presented. In this field, the dispersion/attenuation analysis and wave-field simulation are two key measurements
which can be carried out by solving wave equations. The Biot–squirt (BISQ) equation is a classical wave propagation model
in geophysical forward modeling and has been widely used. The solution of such equation, especially by numerical method,
is often complex and time-consuming. In this work, a DNN model is trained with the dataset of velocity and inverse quality
factor generated from BISQ model. The results show that the relative mean square error between the predictions of DNN
model and that of BISQ model on the test sets are all less than 3%. It indicates that the DNN model has learned the highdimensional space well and then can realize the dispersion/attenuation analysis for any given rock physical parameters.
Besides, the other well-trained DNN model is used to obtain the simulation results with second-order accuracy according to
results by finite difference scheme with first-order accuracy. It reveals that the fast wave-field simulation can be implemented
once the results with lower accuracy are obtained.

Introduction
In recent years, the demand for energy resources, such as oil and
gas, in various industries is increasing. In oil and gas deposit
research, we heavily rely on how to determine the distribution
locations and storage capacity of the underground reservoirs
(e.g., Müller et al. 2010; Mavko et al. 2020). It is well-known in
the seismic exploration that the dynamics of wave propagation
in porous media saturated with fluids is important to predict
the underground reservoir and attracts the interests of many
geoscientists (Müller et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is commonly
accepted that the Biot and squirt-flow theories can be seen as
the two most important mechanisms to characterize the energy
dissipation which is caused by the wave-induced fluid flows
in fluid-saturated rocks (Carcione 2007; Müller et al. 2010).
Biot’s theory consists of the macroscopic rock properties and is
used to describe the macroscopic flow. The squirt-flow theory
is related to the squirting mechanism of the pore fluid out of
the cracks and based on the microscopic rock properties. Obviously, these two mechanisms occur simultaneously and affect

each other, as well as the energy dissipation during seismic
wave propagation.
Dvorkin and Nur (1993), Dvorkin et al. (1995) developed a consistent model dealing the Biot and squirt theories as a couple process. It is the widely used Biot/squirt
(BISQ) model. Many investigators agree that this theory
is adequate to relate the dynamic poroelastic performance
of porous media containing fluids to the geophysical constants such as porosity, bulk modulus and fluid saturation
(Yang and Zhang 2002). It has served as rigorous and formal
foundations to interpret various wave phenomena. Numerous efforts were made to study the solutions of the BISQ
model. These theories mainly focus on the plane wave solutions which can analyze the wave dispersion and attenuation,
and the numerical results by numerical methods which can
simulate the wave propagation in rocks saturated with fluids.
The finite difference (FD) method is widely used to solve
wave equations in numerical simulation (e.g., Carcione and
Quiroga-Goode 1995; Carcione 2007; He et al. 2013). In
traditional, the numerical methods concern the accuracy of
the constructed schemes. More recently, it has been indicated that the stability analysis of wave propagation models
and the corresponding FD methods are also necessary to
the numerical simulations (Liu and Yong 2016; Liu et al.
2020; Xiong et al. 2020a, b). For this issue, Liu et al. (2020)
constructed two finite difference schemes which are able
to offer the stable numerical simulations. On the one hand,
the plane wave solutions for BISQ model can be degenerate
to find the roots of equations as long as the parameters of
porous media are determined. It also means that such solutions need to recalculate the roots once any change occurs
in the constant parameters, and thus it is lack of flexibility
in some way. On the other hand, the second-order scheme
can provide more accurate solutions but requires much more
cost in computation which is almost three times than that of
the first-order scheme. The motivation behind this work is to
overcome such inconvenience and costliness in calculation.
In view of this, it can be considered by using the deep learning technology which is very popular currently.
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning and has
been widely explored in many different applications (Apolinario-Arzube et al. 2020; Nosratabadi et al. 2020; Pilz
et al. 2020). In the field of geophysics, machine learning
technology has been used to deal with problems extensively
and only a small part can be cited here. Maiti et al. (2007)
employed neural network for lithological classification
and modeling according to well log data. Pilz et al. (2020)
studied data-driven and machine learning identification of
seismic reference stations in Europe. Agarwal et al. (2020)
proposed a surrogate model based on machine learning to
study Mars’ thermal evolution. Yang and Ma (2019) applied
deep learning algorithm to geophysical inversion work, and
they built a fully convolutional neural network to seismic

13

wave imaging, which established a new seismic velocity
model building method.
Deep neural network (DNN) is a data-driven technology in deep learning and has been used extensively. DNN
has some outstanding advantages in the practical problems
of establishing surrogate model (Mehta et al. 2019): it has
strong expression ability and outstanding ability to establish
(nonlinear) mapping relationship between data sets. In addition, its application in image processing shows its powerful
ability to process high-dimensional data sets. On the work in
rock physics, Moseley et al. (2020) proposed the “WaveNet
network” based on deep neural network to realize fast simulation of wave propagation. The classical acoustic equation is
used to generate data, and the results showed that the network
can achieve rapid simulation even in complex media through
the test of some special geological models. Some researchers
had also tried to solve the classical wave equations by DNN
model (Siahkoohi et al. 2019). In addition, a representative
work is that You et al. (2020) employed the DNNs to study
shale anisotropy modeling. They constantly tune the hyperparameters to determine the optimal network construction.
The generation of datasets depends on Hudson-Cheng model
(Cheng 1993). They formalized an inversion workflow to
estimate anisotropy from well logs and also compared the
results obtained by DNN and conventional inversion methods
(Li et al. 2019). It has been showed that anisotropy parameters predicted by DNN model agree well with that of inversion results and laboratory measurements. However, as far as
we know, there is not much work in applying DNN to wave
propagation model with partial differential equations form.
This is partially caused by the solution of the equations is
difficult and the difficulty in obtaining actual data.
As a new model establishing method, this study uses
DNN to link the seismic attributes with basic rock physics parameters, which is a data-driven approach instead of
relying on mathematical and physical knowledge. Relationships between different datasets are captured by DNN in
this study. Also we aim to model the numerical results from
BISQ model by the dispersion/attenuation analysis and finite
difference method accurately in a cost-effective manner
using DNNs. We focus on the flexibility of the DNN model
applied in the high-dimensional space and the high efficiency when used in the wave-field simulation. Similar work
can be applied to other classical wave propagation models.
In Sect. 2, the classical BISQ model and the corresponding
two solution methods are reviewed. With these, two kinds
of theoretical datasets can be produced based on the plane
wave analysis and numerical results from FD methods. Furthermore, the process of the data preparation and the design
of DNN model based on tuning the related hyper-parameters
are also introduced with the detailed description. In Sect. 3,
the qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the
DNN surrogate models and the original wave propagation

Acta Geophysica (2022) 70:593–607

model are given and discussed. Firstly, an extensive dataset
that covers the physically reasonable range of each parameter is produced by the original BISQ model based on plane
wave analysis. The accuracy of DNN model can be guaranteed from the error distribution of the network in test
set. Further, several special test sets are used to show that
the DNN model can learn the high-dimensional parameter
space well and then obtain the great interpolation effect.
Thus, it is convenient to get reasonable prediction by DNN
model according to any input data. Moreover, two kinds of
finite difference schemes with different accuracy are used
to solve BISQ model to get the datasets. The results show
that the wave-field simulation results with second-order
accuracy can be obtained by inputting the results with firstorder accuracy into the trained network, which can improve
efficiency and save time. It is demonstrated that the trained
DNN model can be a surrogate model of the original BISQ
model. Last comes the conclusions in Sect. 4.

Dispersion and attenuation analysis of the fast P wave characterized by velocity VP and inverse quality factor Q−1 can be
carried out based on wave propagation models. The variation
of the two quantities with the basic parameters such as rock
porosity and fluid saturation can also be investigated. Meanwhile, the process of wave propagation can be simulated by
solving the wave equation numerically. Generally, the scheme
with high accuracy is more complex. Many solutions for
wave equations have been constructed specifically to consider
the accuracy, while the stability of these schemes may not
be guaranteed. Thus, it may provide unstable and expensive
simulation results when applied in the realistic cases.
Among the well-established wave equations, BISQ
model developed by Dvorkin and Nur [3,4] is widely used
and attracts many interests. The objective of this work is to
provide the DNN model to surrogate such a classical model
in two aspects. Firstly, dispersion and attenuation prediction
can be directly realized by DNN model. Then high precision simulation results can be obtained as the original model
solved with stable FD schemes to reduce the instability.

where ρf1, ρf2 and η1, η2 are the density and viscosity of
fluid 1 and 2, respectively. It should be noted that the basic
parameters are ω, ϕ, Ks, μs, ρs, Sw and κ once the type of
fluids are fixed in this model. Specific calculation formula
and details can be seen in references (Dvorkin and Nur 1993;
Dvorkin et al. 1995).
As mentioned above, a workflow is established to analyze
the wave dispersion and attenuation in geophysics, and the
FD schemes selected to solve Eq. (1) in numerical. First, the
Fourier transformation with respect to h and t is applied to get
the velocity VP and inverse quality factor Q−1. According to
the principle of plane wave analysis, one can look for solutions
of wave equation in the following form:

BISQ model and the solutions
The BISQ model incorporated the Biot and squirt-flow
mechanisms. Firstly, based on the elasto-dynamic relationships derived by Biot (1956a, b), Rice and Cleary (1976),
the motion equations which describe the deformation of the
solid and fluid are:

where Re(k) and Im(k) denote the real and imaginary parts

In addition to the plane wave solutions, the numerical
simulation results from the FD methods are also the key
issue to solve the wave equations. The first- and secondorder FD schemes are constructed in our previous work
(Liu et al. 2020). For this issue, Liu et al. (2020), which
can minimize the instability in calculations, are employed
to numerically simulate the wave propagation in an isotropic porous medium.
By means of the operator splitting theory and the
upwind difference scheme, the first-order scheme for BISQ

Data preparation and the DNN design

Then, substitute each row of X into Eqs. (1)–(6) to get the
velocity and the inverse quality factor, which forms the output
and also the label of neural network as follows:

For a physical model, the corresponding output(s) can be
obtained for a given set of parameters, during which the
influence of some parameters on the results can be investigated. In this case, the physical model acts as the bridge
between the inputs (parameters) and outputs (results). While
in some cases, although a large number of data can be collected, the model characterizing the relationship between
them is unknown. Note X and Y as two matrices composed
of data points with a certain amount. Further, for such an
issue suppose there are m variables included in X and each
of them has n sample points,
namely 𝐗 ∈] ℝm×n and
[
T
[
]
𝐗 = 𝐱1 , 𝐱2 , … , 𝐱n , where 𝐱i = xi(1) , xi(2) , … , xi(m) is the i-th
component
of X, and]i = 1, 2, …, n. Similarly, 𝐘 ∈ ℝm×l and
[
T
𝐲j = y(1)
, y(2)
, … , yj(m) is the j-th component of Y, where
j
j
j = 1, 2, …, l. In practice, it is often needed to explore the
relationship between two datasets, and thus X and Y can be
regarded as independent and dependent variable,
respectively.
Generally, deep neural networks are data-driven technique and frequently used to solve problems in the black
box. Therefore, instead of establishing an explicit function
relation like Y = f (X) in the traditional way, it can be considered to establish relationship between the two datasets by
DNN as ‘ 𝐘̂ = net(X)’, where X and 𝐘̂ are the input and output of a DNN model, respectively, and 𝐘̂ is equal to or very
close to Y. According to this kind of thoughts, the DNN
model is used to realize two functions of BISQ model in this
work. The designed DNN can not only calculate the dispersion and attenuation of the fast P wave, but also realize the
numerical simulation of wave propagation by FD scheme
with second-order accuracy. Thus, two DNN models will
be trained below. Although it takes some time to train the
neural network, similar results as the original BISQ model
can be obtained quickly if the network is trained well. Once
a large number of repeated calculations are needed, it is
easy to complete and will save time based on a trained DNN
model.
For the calculation of dispersion and attenuation, seven rock
physical parameters are sampled m times randomly within
their value range, and this forms the input dataset 𝐗 ∈ ℝm×7
as follows:

⎡ V (1) Q−1,(1) ⎤
⎢ P(2) −1,(2) ⎥
V Q
⎥,
𝐘=⎢ P
⎢ ⋮
⎥
⋮
⎢ V (m) Q−1,(m) ⎥
⎣ P
⎦
where 𝐘 ∈ ℝm×2.
Note that random sampling is used in parameter space since
it is difficult to do grid search in high-dimensional parameter
space, and random search is often more effective than grid
search actually (Bergstra and Bengio 2012). It should be noted
that the variation of VP caused by different parameters differs, which may make it difficult to train the network. Thus,
each component of Y will be normalized to a same range after
obtaining the raw outputs. Once the calculation of Y according to X and the related preprocessing work completed, the
whole dataset are divided into training and test sets one by one
randomly. In addition, a validation set composed of part of the
whole dataset is needed when designing the network.
Meanwhile, as introduced above, an accurate numerical
method for solving the BISQ equations is important for the
full waveform inversion, but normally expensive in calculation. To improve this issue, the effective numerical simulations
for one-dimensional case via DNN model is carried out based
on the intrinsic one-to-one correspondence between the timestepping algorithms with first- and second-order accuracy as
mentioned in Sect. 2.2. In this case, the input and output of
DNN model are the simulation results by the first- and secondorder scheme, respectively. A set of wave-field snapshots can
be obtained for a given set of rock physical parameters and
calculation time. Specifically, suppose that the spatial range
can be divided into NX grid points and m sets of rock physical parameters are sampled randomly, the calculation time is
fixed at T, the dataset of simulation results 𝐗 ∈ ℝm×NX with
first-order accuracy can be written as follows:

and j = 1, 2, …, NX. The elements of X varies at different
times. The simulation results 𝐘 ∈ ℝm×NX with second-order
accuracy can be written in the same way. The partition of the
dataset is the same as above.
The simulation by the scheme with second-order accuracy is much more time-consuming than that of the firstorder, and thus the results with higher accuracy according
to the results with lower accuracy can be obtained by DNN
model in a shorter time once the network is trained well.
The structure of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is adopted
here to design DNN model. As is well-known, many hyperparameters need to be determined to construct a DNN
model. It can be done by trial and error to select the optimal
one or according to empiricism or both. For simplicity in
principle, different hyper-parameters are selected to calculate the training and validation loss. The test set is randomly
selected from 50% of the given data set and used to investigate DNN’s performance after training. The validation set
is a subset of the test set in this study, and its number of data
points is 10% of the given data set. The DNN models used
below are the optimal one through multiple attempts. Here,
the optimal DNN model means three aspects. First of all,
the constructed neural network should ensure the accuracy
of training, and the lowest minimal validation loss can be
obtained. Secondly, the depth and width of the DNN should
be as small as possible to reduce the computational resources
required. Lastly, there will be no overfitting problem. In this

DNN is shown in the dashed

ranges

work, Pytorch is used to realize the construction and calculation of neural network.
As shown in Fig. 1, the optimal construction of DNN
is a fully connected network with three hidden layers, and
each hidden layer has 150 nodes. After each, middle hidden layer is the activation function. The activation function
is selected as Tanh instead of ReLU since its derivative is
discontinuous (Jagtap et al. 2020; Kharazmi et al. 2021;
Oostwal et al. 2021). Note that the elements of X need to
be normalized to a special range (e.g., [−1, 1]) to avoid the
problem of gradient vanishing. Training a DNN is a process
of updating network parameters (weight and bias) based on
continuously optimizing the loss function, which is taken
as the mean square error (MSE) between the prediction of
DNN 𝐘̂ and the label Y. The Adam optimizer (Kingma and
Ba 2014) is used here since its convergence speed is faster
compared with other optimizers such as stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) with momentum. The initial learning rate is
set to 0.001, and a technique of learning rate decay is used
here based on the function “lr_scheduler,” a built-in function for adjusting the learning rate along with the number
of epochs in Pytorch (Paszke et al. 2017). It makes the loss
function decrease more stable and avoids the large oscillation of loss curve.
In short, the general workflow of the DNN model to
replace the BISQ model proposed in this work is as follows:
first, the preprocessed data are taken as the input of the DNN

Acta Geophysica (2022) 70:593–607

model and then training the neural network. The criterion
to identify the success of network training is whether the
training error and the test error decrease and converge to a
similar relatively low value after some epochs. The outputs
are scaled back to normal ranges of each quantity by label
denormalization. Finally, different dataset are used to test the
trained DNN model, and the calculation process of obtaining the output from input is very fast since the network has
been trained.

which can get the similar results as the original BISQ model
for dispersion and attenuation. Furthermore, it will be shown
that the accurate wave-fields, e.g., with second-order accuracy, can be directly obtained through the inaccurate approximation to the wave equations.

Wave dispersion and attenuation
The dispersion and attenuation of the fast P wave are always
seen as a key point to reveal the fluid flow mechanism in the
rocks. In this way, the performance of wave velocity (VP) and
inverse attenuation quality factor (Q−1) on different parameters were tested and a surrogate model for dispersion and
attenuation prediction was established.
Firstly, 1,400,000 data points were produced by sampling the basic parameters of the BISQ model randomly,
they are frequency (ω), porosity (ϕ), the bulk modulus of
solid (Ks), the shear modulus of solid (μs), the density of
solid (ρs), water saturation (Sw) and permeability (κ). The
sampling range on these parameters referred to the reasonable range of each parameter in physics for different rock
samples (Mavko et al. 2020) as shown in Table 1, which
aims to ensure the reality and consider more possibilities.
Based on these parameter combinations, the BISQ model
was employed to generate 1,400,000 paired data of features
(i.e., the inputs of the DNN model) and labels (i.e., ground
truth for the outputs of the DNN model). The time discussed
in this paper is under the condition of the same computer
resources. On personal computer, it takes less than 15 min
to produce such a data set. The generated dataset was split
into training and test subsets with a ratio of 1:1. Normally,
the training subset was chosen to train the network while
the test subset was used to evaluate the trained DNN model.
As required by the procedure from Eqs. (1) to (6), the
seven parameters ω, ϕ, Ks, μs, ρs, Sw and κ were set as the
inputs and VP, Q−1 as the outputs, respectively. Thus, two
high-dimensional function spaces were produced as:

VP =VP 𝜔, 𝜙, Ks , 𝜇s , 𝜌s , Sw , 𝜅 ,
(
)
Q−1 = Q−1 𝜔, 𝜙, Ks , 𝜇s , 𝜌s , Sw , 𝜅 .
With the above formulations, it will be convenient to
precisely describe the dependence of VP and Q−1 on the
arbitrary multiple combinations of such seven parameters.
The DNN model was trained with the hyper-parameters as
mentioned in Sect. 2. For convenience, they are summarized
in Table 2. Among them, the loss function is defined as the
MSE between VP and Q−1 calculated
model and

It

complete the training on personal computer since the amount
of data is large. Once the network is trained, the predicted VP
and Q−1 can be obtained instantly by feeding X into the DNN
model. Figure 2 shows the loss curve for the training process.
On a whole, the training loss shown in Fig. 2 decreases
and converges to relatively low values after 10,000 epochs.
The training and validation loss converge at the same level.
The curve declines in a relatively smooth trend. The optimal
DNN model was obtained at Epoch 50,000, where the training loss reaches its minimum, and the test loss of this DNN
model is almost as low as the training loss. This fact reveals
that the training of the DNN model is successful.
After the training process, 700,000 data points were chosen as test set to compare the prediction of DNN model with
the ground truth by the BISQ model. The corresponding frequency distribution map of the variations between the truth
and predictions of the trained DNN model ΔVP is shown

13

600

in Fig. 3. The frequency of ΔVP is obtained by dividing
the number of data points with the same value range by the
total number of data points. Note that 68 abnormal points for
velocity prediction and 26 points for inverse quality factor
prediction were deleted since this will make the variation
range too large. Then, the variation ranges of VP and Q−1
are [−19.738, 28.556] and [−0.0519, 0.0384], respectively.
Obviously, both the variation ranges of VP and Q−1 focus on
0 and comparing the mean values of these two quantities,

green solid lines, respectively. The validation set is a subset of the test
set. The DNN model is tested on test set at Epoch 50, 000, and the
value of the test loss is 3.19e-2, which is almost the same as the convergence value of training loss

it is obvious that the relative error is also small enough. It
indicates that the DNN model has learned the two highdimensional function spaces well and confirms the wellperformance of this algorithm.
Among the chosen seven parameters, wave frequency
(ω) contributes to observe the dissipation amplitude of
energy, porosity (ϕ) represents the ability of solid to contain fluids, water saturation (Sw) determines the composition of fluids, which can be seen as three key factors in
describing the interested reservoirs with special significance in geophysics. To further illustrate the level of accuracy with DNN model, three special test sets related to
the three parameters were constructed to display the misfit between the two models. Only one parameter varied
in each test set within the range as shown in Table 1, and
the other six parameters were taken as their mean value,
respectively. Obviously, this newly constructed test set is
not concluded in and more complex than the original datasets produced by random sampling as mentioned above.

As shown in Fig. 4, the velocity and attenuation curves
calculated by the original BISQ model (black line) and DNN
model (red line) on three representative test sets show the
high consistency in the whole calculation range. This further manifests the fact that the proposed DNN model has
already got the BISQ model in the two high-dimensional
spaces. Besides, it should be noted that the points at one end
in Fig. 4e and f occur certain misfits compared with others

be greatly influenced when the containing fluid changed from

which Sw = 0 and 1.
In addition, the mean absolute error (MAE) and rootmean-square error (RMSE) corresponding to each plots in
Fig. 4 are introduced and listed in Table 3 to evaluate the
performance of the DNN model. The MAE and RMSE which
is used to reveal the overall misfit between the ground truth
(ytruth) and the output (yout) of DNN model can be expressed
as:

MAE =

RMSE = √

where RMSE offers the larger errors higher weights and
then can prevent the unexpected large errors, and MAE
weights the errors for any components equally.
As listed in Table 3, the MAE and RMSE values for the
same case are similar. The maximum values are no more
than 2.162, which means that all the simulations performed
well.
At the end of this subsection, 28 laboratory measurements of rock samples collected from the published paper
(Wang 2017) were introduced to test and verify the ability
of DNN model as a surrogate model for any arbitrary input.
The experimental data provided by Wang (2017) contained
the density of fluid-saturated medium ρ, the velocity of compression wave VP, the velocity of shear wave Vs instead of
Ks, μs, ρs and κ. In such a case, it is needed to supplement the
inputs of DNN model by the following formulations (Wang
2017):

yout (e.g., the predictions of DNN model) of VP is shown in
Fig. 5. The great agreement provides the robust proof that
the DNN model trained well-enough to offer an accurate
approximation to the BISQ model for different geological
dataset.
To sum up, the DNN algorithm was successfully
trained and tested on the wave attenuation and dispersion calculations. Unlike the prediction by BISQ model,
the well-trained DNN model can quickly give the simulation result at any point from the multidimensional
domain consisted of ω, ϕ, K s, μ s, ρ s, S w and κ, without
the recalculation of roots for different input parameters.

Application to the wave propagation simulation
In order to clarify the effectiveness of the low-to-high
accuracy implemented by DNN model precisely, it is motivated to compare the simulation results from the secondorder scheme mentioned above with the trained DNN, in
which the calculation domain was fixed at h ∈ [−2000 m,
2000 m], the spatial increment Δh = 10 m, and the timestep size Δt = 0.001 s, while the calculation time and the

In this example, the loss function is defined as the MSE
between VP by BISQ model and that of DNN’s prediction,
i.e., Y = [VP]. It only takes a few minutes to complete the
training since the amount of data is small (about 2000).
A wave propagation model that can describe these data is
obtained by training the DNN model. The bivariate distribution map of ytruth (e.g., the laboratory measurements) and

experimental samples used were varied. The source term
is a vertical point force with a Ricker wavelet:
(
)
(
)
s(t) = 1 − 2𝜋 2 𝜔20 t2 exp −𝜋 2 𝜔20 t2 ,
in which the peak frequency ω0 is 35 Hz, π = 3.14. The
source is located at the center of the space domain, e.g.,
h = 0 m. Under the same conditions, the calculation time of
the second order is at least three times that of the first order
(Liu et al. 2020).
In the following, the snapshot of wave-fields differ in the
time period of the wave propagation which was compared.
The observation time points were set as 0.1 s, 0.2 s, 0.3 s and
0.4 s, while keeping the space domain fixed. The training
and testing subsets were generated based on the experimental samples (Xiong et al. 2020a, b; Liu et al. 2020). Among
them, 40,128 paired data of features (results by first-order
scheme) and labels (results by second-order scheme) were
produced. The generated dataset was split into training and
test subsets with a ratio of 8:2. The loss function is defined
as the MSE between the wave-field by the second-order
scheme and that of DNN’s prediction. It takes about 19 h to
generate the dataset and no more than half an hour to train
the network. Due to the calculation time required by the
first-order and second-order schemes differ much, the trained
network can produce the second-order results instantly as
long as the results by the first-order scheme are given.
The loss curve and the statistics of DNN’s prediction
accuracy on the test set are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6a,
the loss curve for the DNN model of wave-field snapshot
also decreases and converged to relatively low values which
are almost same as the test loss.

Meanwhile, we investigate the effect of the trained network on the test set. As shown in Fig. 6b, the RMSE of the
normalized amplitude of snapshot ΔA0 focus on 5%, indicating that the DNN model was trained well and could be
generalized to other dataset. In this way, two rock samples
listed in Table 4 were selected to validate the trained DNN
model here.
Figures 7 shows the comparison between the trained
DNN model (black solid lines) and the BISQ model solved
with the second-order finite difference scheme (red dashed
lines). The amplitudes of each plot were normalized by the
maximum value. The desired outputs of the trained DNN
are the second-order wave-field snapshots simulated on
space domain during the wave propagation. As it can be
seen, the DNN model holds the quality of simulating the
wave propagation for the whole space domain with different
time points and experimental data. Note that the numerical simulation results from the two methods were all stable
during the wave propagation which is due to the stability of
the selected first- and second-order schemes. It means that

To prove the robustness of our method, we add 1,

to the labels, we retrain the network and investigate the

prediction accuracy on the same parameters as Fig. 7c.
As shown in Fig. 8, adding 1 and 2% noise has little
effect on the results. Although adding 5% noise causes
some small oscillations in the result, the overall results
are still acceptable. The amplitude of the wave signal
in each plot is normalized, and the RMSE is 0.32, 0.51
and 1.12% respectively. Compared with the prediction
accuracy without noise, i.e., 0.26%, the error increases
relatively smoothly. It shows the algorithm is robust to
small noise.

Conclusions
This study presented the application of deep neural network for the wave propagation models in geoscience. By
means of different synthetic data and experimental data, the
comparisons of numerical simulation result demonstrate
that the well-trained DNN model is capable of approximating the attenuation and dispersion curves calculated by the
original wave equations, as well as the snapshot of wavefield simulated by high-accuracy scheme. On the other
hand, this method estimates the plane wave and numerical
solutions from geophysical data in less time. It makes the
solutions of wave equations considerably faster than previous schemes, which is particularly useful for large-scale
measurements. The use of DNN model for wave equations
also opens up a wide-arsenal of the solutions that assist to
carry out the real-time forward simulations.
Future work intends to apply the DNN for more
complex equation systems. Such application may significantly reduce the calculated time need for the wave
equation simulations and may give the chance to carry
out the optimal option of various rock physics models
and unknown parameters to interpret any interested seismic dataset. Among them, data augmentations (Grill
et al. 2020) can be applied to strengthen the quality of
training.
