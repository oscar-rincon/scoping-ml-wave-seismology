Numerical methods such as finite difference (FD) modelling and spectral element methods (SEMs) are the most popular techniques for simulating seismic waves, but disadvantages such as their computational cost prohibit their use for many tasks. In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning for aiding seismic simulation in the solid Earth sciences. We present two deep neural networks which are able to simulate the seismic response at multiple locations in horizontally layered and faulted 2-D acoustic media an order of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference modelling. The first network is able to simulate the seismic response in horizontally layered media and uses a WaveNet network architecture design. The second network is significantly more general than the first and is able to simulate the seismic response in faulted media with arbitrary layers, fault properties and an arbitrary location of the seismic source on the surface of the media, using a conditional autoencoder design. We test the sensitivity of the accuracy of both networks to different network hyperparameters and show that the WaveNet network can be retrained to carry out fast seismic inversion in the same media. We find that are there are challenges when extending our methods to more complex, elastic and 3-D Earth models; for example, the accuracy of both networks is reduced when they are tested on models outside of their training distribution. We discuss further research directions which could address these challenges and potentially yield useful tools for practical simulation tasks.","2020-08-24","2024-11-28 23:35:01","2025-02-26 19:58:49","2024-08-17 18:17:06","1527-1549","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Copernicus Online Journals","","Cited by - 80","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\K44UUPV7\Moseley et al. - 2020 - Deep learning for fast simulation of seismic waves.pdf","","Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their application is limited by high computational costs and existing surrogate models lack the flexibility of numerical solvers. This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.","2024-04-15","2024-09-04 19:54:39","2024-11-26 21:51:08","2024-09-04 19:54:39","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Cited by - 0 - Preprint - 22 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XWEX83JI\Lehmann et al. - 2024 - Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GHCNY9GA\2404.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2404.10115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this field, the dispersion/attenuation analysis and wave-field simulation are two key measurements which can be carried out by solving wave equations. The Biot–squirt (BISQ) equation is a classical wave propagation model in geophysical forward modeling and has been widely used. The solution of such equation, especially by numerical method, is often complex and time-consuming. In this work, a DNN model is trained with the dataset of velocity and inverse quality factor generated from BISQ model. The results show that the relative mean square error between the predictions of DNN model and that of BISQ model on the test sets are all less than 3%. It indicates that the DNN model has learned the high-dimensional space well and then can realize the dispersion/attenuation analysis for any given rock physical parameters. Besides, the other well-trained DNN model is used to obtain the simulation results with second-order accuracy according to results by finite difference scheme with first-order accuracy. It reveals that the fast wave-field simulation can be implemented once the results with lower accuracy are obtained.","2022","2024-07-24 21:50:24","2024-11-26 21:50:34","","593-607","","2","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Cited by - 2 - 33 - Yes- Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\2DASUSEX\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TK7DMNLD\Xiong et al. - 2022 - Deep-neural-networks-based approaches for Biot–squ.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\Y44A94F8\Xiong et al. - 2022 - Deep-neural-networks-based approaches for Biot–squ.pdf","","","Deep neural network; Dispersion and attenuation; Numerical simulation; Training and test; Wave propagation model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study leverages the inherent connection between the temporal-spatial stepping processes and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as well as convolutional layers (CLs) to propose a general-purpose recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) platform for solving PDEs. The RCNN platform rigorously executes the temporal-spatial iterations involved in discretized forms of PDEs. Furthermore, benefiting from the latest advancements in deep learning, the platform enhances the efficiency of convolutional computations.

Thousands of such forward simulations are often a routine requirement for parameter estimation of microseimsic events via a suitable source inversion process. Parameter estimation based on forward modelling is often advantageous over a direct regression-based inversion approach when there are unknown number of parameters to be estimated and the seismic data have complicated noise characteristics which may not always allow a stable and unique solution in a direct inversion process. In this paper, starting from Graphics Processing Unit based synthetic simulations of a few thousand forward seismic shots due to microseismic events via pseudo-spectral solution of elastic wave equation, we develop a step-by-step process to generate a surrogate regression modelling framework, using machine learning techniques that can produce accurate seismograms at specified receiver locations. The trained surrogate models can then be used as a high-speed meta-model/emulator or proxy for the original full elastic wave propagator to generate seismic responses for other microseismic event locations also. The accuracies of the surrogate models have been evaluated using two independent sets of training and testing Latin hypercube quasi-random samples, drawn from a heterogeneous marine velocity model. The predicted seismograms have been used thereafter to calculate batch likelihood functions, with specified noise characteristics. Finally, the trained models on 23 receivers placed at the sea-bed in a marine velocity model are used to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the event locations which can in future be used in a Bayesian analysis for microseismic event detection. © The Author(s) 2018.","2018","2024-08-24 17:27:17","2024-11-26 21:49:08","","1257-1290","","2","215","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 15 - 76 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\2H72UXL7\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\W7ZK9TN4\Das et al. - 2018 - Surrogate regression modelling for fast seismogram.pdf","","computational seismology","Joint inversion; Seismic noise; Statistical methods; Statistical seismology; Time-series analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total cost strictly depends on the number of frequency components that are considered, if using a finite-difference method. For the applications such as seismic imaging and inversion, high-frequency information is always required and thus the wave simulation is always a challenging task as it demands tremendous computational cost for obtaining dispersion-free high-frequency wavefields for large subsurface models. This paper demonstrates that a data-driven machine learning method, called the Fourier neural operator (FNO), is capable of predicting high-frequency wavefields, based on a limited number of low-frequency components. As the FNO method is for the first time applied to seismic wavefield extrapolation, the experiment reveals three attractive features with FNO: high efficiency, high accuracy and, importantly, the predicted high-frequency wavefields are dispersion free. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The monofrequency equation has the form of a Helmholtz equation. When solving the Helmholtz equation for seismic wavefields with multiple frequencies, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be used. However, the PINN suffers from the problem of spectral bias when approximating high-frequency components. We propose to simulate seismic multifrequency wavefields using a PINN with an embedded Fourier feature. The input to the Fourier feature PINN for simulating multifrequency wavefields is 4-D, namely the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates of the model, the horizontal position of the source, and the frequency, and the output is multifrequency wavefields at arbitrary source positions. While an effective Fourier feature initialization strategy can lead to optimal convergence in training this network, the Fourier feature PINN simulates multifrequency wavefields with reasonable efficiency and accuracy. © 2022 The Author(s).
