ABSTRACT
Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is considered as a scalable approach for massive storage and seasonal
extraction of hydrogen (H2 ). Although conventional leakage detection and characterization methods based on
time-lapse seismic imaging and inversion generally apply to H2 leakage detection problem, a high-fidelity yet
cost effective geophysics approach is still missing to reliably inform leakage location and properties based
on very sparse data. In response, we develop a novel supervised machine learning method to detect and
characterize H2 leakage from UHS. The input to our neural network are sparse time-lapse seismic waveforms,
while the output from the neural network includes the spatial location and physical properties of a H2 leakage.
We generate high-quality time-lapse waveforms using the elastic-wave equations to train the neural network.
We train and validate our machine learning model and find that it attains high accuracy in using extremely
sparse time-lapse seismic data to detect and characterize H2 leakage. Our investigation is the first systematic
study that focuses on applying machine learning to subsurface H2 leakage detection and characterization and
could potentially serve as a cost-effective geophysical tool for underground hydrogen leakage detection and
characterization with high fidelity.

1. Introduction
Renewable energies in various forms, including wind, solar, water
flow, waves, geothermal, and so on, are considered to be the key to
achieving net-zero emission and slowing global warming. However,
a major issue associated with renewable energies is the imbalance
between the energy demand and the spatial–temporal availability of
renewable energies [1]. Some of these renewable energies are also
difficult to be transported with an economic viable approach, leading
to geospatial limitations in using these energies.
Hydrogen is considered to be one of the most important clean
alternatives to fossil energy. H2 can be naturally generated from the
reaction of ultramafic and mafic rocks that are rich in iron (Fe) and
magnesium (Mg) with anoxic water at temperatures >200 ◦ C as a
spontaneous reaction [2], potentially offering an almost limitless renewable energy resource. However, natural H2 generation is far from
commercial scale exploration. A more commercially feasible way for
producing H2 is through water electrolysis, which can be driven by
redundant energy (mainly in the form of electricity) generated by
other forms of renewable energy, a paradigm known as Power-to-Gas
technology [3]. Generated H2 can be stored both above ground or
within the subsurface, which is later extracted to meet seasonal or
cyclic energy demand peaks with high portability.

Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is considered to be a scalable approach for massive storage and cyclic extraction [4–6]. UHS
can leverage depleted oil and gas fields similar to geological carbon
sequestration (GCS) [7,8], as well as saline aquifers and salt or hard
rock caverns [9] because of their superb sealing capability. However,
massive subsurface storage of H2 , as in the case of GCS, may cause
significant hydrodynamical, geomechanical, and/or biological consequences, and face a number of fundamental scientific and engineering
challenges for mitigating these issues [10]. From a geophysical point of
view, seasonal and cyclic H2 injection and extraction could potentially
induce seismicity by changing subsurface stress [11,12] and may cause
leakage of H2 through hidden leakage channels (e.g., breakage of
sealing caprock or reactivation of nearby faults) [13], both of which
may cause significant societal concerns and environmental risks.
Long-term safe operation of any UHS therefore requires high-fidelity
monitoring capable of evaluating operational risks and ensuring the
integrity of overlying caprocks or aquifers. When H2 leaks into surrounding geological layers, it may alter the petrophysical properties
of the rock, including the fluid saturation, density, elastic moduli, and
thus apparent seismic wave propagation velocities. A geophysical way
to achieving high-fidelity monitoring of subsurface reservoir leakage is
to perform active-source time-lapse seismic imaging, where one uses

To address these challenges, we develop a novel supervised neural
network (NN) that consists of a 2D CNN module and a dense neural
network (DNN) module (e.g., [39]). The CNN modules extract spatial
features from the input time-lapse seismic waveforms that are represented by a single-channel 2D image and transfers the learned features
to the DNN module for regression. The output from the NN contains
the location (measured using the spatial range of the leakage: 𝐱min , 𝐱max
where 𝐱 = (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)) and the properties (including the leakage mass 𝑀
and leakage volume 𝑉 ). The motivation of our NN can be represented
by the following simple diagram:

the differential waveforms between the leakage-stage and the baseline
stage to image or invert for the spatial location and induced medium
parameter changes (e.g., [14–17]). There are several issues associated
with active-source time-lapse monitoring of H2 leakage. Firstly, in
some cases, the non-repeatable factors in a time-lapse seismic survey,
such as source time function, observation system inconsistency, and
coherent noise, need to be processed first or be mitigated, which is
a challenging task even with specialized processing methods [18,19].
Secondly, although time-lapse seismic imaging and inversion are plausible and usually the most reliable geophysical method because of their
appropriate sensitivity to reservoir changes at the exploration scale,
active-source time-lapse seismic monitoring can be expensive because
dense data acquisition system needs to be deployed, some in a marine
environment. Thirdly, it is usually very challenging, if not impossible,
to obtain directly time-lapse changes of medium parameters other
than seismic velocities (𝑉𝑝 and 𝑉𝑠 ), for instance, porosity, saturation,
and so on, from seismic waveforms, because of the highly nonlinear
relationship between seismic waveforms and petrophysics parameters
(e.g., [20]). The efficacy of conventional time-lapse seismic imaging
and inversion methods can be further stymied in addressing our unique
problem: H2 leakage characterization. Because H2 is a small-molecule
gas and may only cause limited rock property changes, the resulting
time-lapse signals can be weak, adding another layer of uncertainty to
high-fidelity time-lapse monitoring of leakage. The unique challenges
associated with UHS leakage can be schematically depicted in Fig. 1.
Machine learning (ML) provides a prospect for solving challenging
problems in science based on a coalescence of numerical optimization
and statistical inference. First derived in computer vision and natural
language processing (e.g., [21–24]), ML has gained wide applications
to geophysical problems, including earthquake data phase picking (e.g.,
[25,26]), geological interpretation (e.g., [27,28]), signal and image
processing (e.g., [29,30]), subsurface characterization (e.g., [31–33]),
petrophysics of UHS (e.g., [34]), to name only a few. Exploiting ML
for subsurface reservoir leakage detection and characterization is not
new. In the context of GCS monitoring, an application that is similar
to UHS, Wang et al. [35] used a supervised ML method to infer
CO2 leakage saturation based on time-lapse seismic data. However,
the study considers only acoustic-wave propagation as the underlying
physics, which, from a geophysical point of view, is far from sufficiency
to describe the complex time-lapse changes caused by CO2 leakage as
the Earth is essentially elastic, if not more complex like viscoelastic and
poroelastic with or without anisotropies. Zhou et al. [36] developed a
supervised ML method based on convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to infer CO2 leakage
mass from time-lapse seismic data. In addition to a higher computational cost inherent to the LSTM element, their method can only infer
leakage mass. There is also a class of methods that was developed to
infer CO2 leakage and associated properties from post-stack seismic
image [17,37,38] but not from seismic data directly. Leong et al. [20]
developed an ML method for estimating CO2 saturation from timelapse waveforms, and validated the method using Frio-II field data.
This method, however, was developed in the context of cross-well monitoring system, which usually enjoys simpler and less noisy waveforms
compared with surface seismic surveys where reflection waves are the
main carrier of leakage signals. Moreover, none of these methods is
developed to specifically handle sparse seismic data, and therefore does
not indicate a cost-effective prospect when applied to field applications.
These methods do not provide the inference capability to estimate the
spatial location of CO2 , and it is unclear to what efficacy and accuracy
these methods can simultaneously locate the leakage and estimate its
leakage properties. For these reasons, it is unclear if these existing ML
models can be reliably applied to our unique problem (H2 leakage)
with a specific goal (simultaneous inference of leakage location and
leakage properties) using specific data (extremely sparse and/or noisy
time-lapse seismic data).

In this sense, our NN is a multi-task supervised NN that can infer
multiple critical quantities associated with a H2 leakage from UHS.
We generate the training data for this NN using a novel rock physics
model for H2 -saturated porous media and using a finite-differencebased elastic-wave equation solver to generate time-lapse seismic data.
To train a high-fidelity NN that is robust to random noise, one of most
significant factors that impacts time-lapse imaging and inversion, we
also add Gaussian random noise to the training data and investigate
how random noise can affect the accuracy of our NN. For convenience,
we call our ML method HydrogenNet thereinafter.
The rest of the paper will be organized as follows. In the Methodology section, we will describe the architecture of HydrogenNet in details,
including the architecture of both CNN and DNN modules; we will also
describe how we build the novel rock physics model to describe H2
leakage and how we generate high-quality data–label pairs for training
and validating HydrogenNet. In the Results section, we use a synthetic
UHS model to validate the efficacy and accuracy of our HydrogenNet.
In particular, we will investigate how the number of permanent seismic
stations and the level of random noise may affect the accuracy of
HydrogenNet. We summarize our findings in the Conclusions.
2. Methodology
2.1. The fundamental mechanism of HydrogenNet
Our HydrogenNet is a supervised ML method with the input being
the time-lapse seismic waveforms, while the output includes the parameters associated with the potential H2 leakage. The entire workflow of
H2 consists of three essential steps:
1. Training data generation: Build the baseline and leakagestage elastic parameter models for the target area, and perform elastic-wave modeling using a finite-difference or spectralelement solver using the field survey sparse geometry;
2. Training HydrogenNet: Train HydrogenNet using the data,
where input is noisy or noise-free time-lapse waveform while
the output includes the parameters of leakage;
3. Application to field data: Prepare the field time-lapse waveform and feed it to the trained HydrogenNet to obtain H2 leakage
information.
The process must be re-performed for each different UHS region
(different baseline geological models) and different observation geometry (including the spatial distribution of the permanent stations and
location of sources). In the following subsections, we will provide the
details regarding the above three steps.
2.2. H2 leakage rock physics model and data generation
Our HydrogenNet is a supervised NN and therefore relies on highquality training data to obtain high-accuracy generalization for practical applications. Therefore, building realistic models, and in particularly, models that comply with the rock physics of H2 leakage, is

particularly important. We aim to build such a H2 leakage rock physics
model that we can relate the mass and volume of H2 leakage with the
change of seismic velocities (𝑉𝑝 and 𝑉𝑠 ) of the host rock; with this
relationship, we can obtain differential seismic waveforms associated
with the H2 leakage based on the linear elastic wave equation (e.g.,
[40]).
We adopt a similar rock physics model for describing CO2 leakage
in porous rocks [41] to quantify the elastic medium property changes
caused by H2 leakage. Note that in the work we simulate H2 leakage
from a saline aquifer UHS reservoir sealed by some caprock layer on the
top. The leaked H2 escapes from the reservoir through activated faults
or stress-created fractures through the caprock, and enters into the
porous rocks above the caprock, altering the elastic medium properties
of these rocks. Our rock physics model does not consider the H2 -brine
transport physics, the complex interactions among H2 , brine, and rock,
the injection/withdrawal rate and schemes, nor the wettability of a
UHS as discussed by, for instance, Pan et al. [42], all of which can
significantly impact the H2 storage properties and therefore leakage
mechanism. Therefore, the following model is only a simplified representation of H2 leakage and focuses more on the elastic medium
parameter changes rather than H2 diffusion process. Our ML model
detailed in the next section, correspondingly, focuses on characterizing
these changes through seismic signals, rather than the state of a H2
reservoir itself.
Firstly, we use the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) equation of state for H2 to calculate the corresponding sound
speed [43]. The bulk modulus and density of effective pore fluid is
estimated using inverse bulk modulus averaging [44] and arithmetic
averaging of densities of independent fluid phases involved in the
porous system, respectively [45]. Specifically, we compute the effective
pore fluid bulk modulus 𝐾𝑓 and the effective pore fluid density 𝜌𝑓 using

where 𝑆𝑔 is the volume fraction of gas (H2 ) saturation, 𝐾𝑔 is the bulk
modulus of H2 , 𝐾𝑤 is the bulk modulus of brine, 𝜌𝑔 is the density of
H2 , and 𝜌𝑤 is the density of brine.
Secondly, we estimate the bulk and shear moduli (𝐾𝑚 and 𝜇𝑚 )
of mineral grains by taking Voigt–Reuss–Hill averaging [46] of the
mineral constituents with published experimental moduli [47,48]. We
also assume 70% quartz and 30% clay and assume 𝐾𝑚 and 𝜇𝑚 have negligible dependence on stress within near-surface reservoirs (e.g., UHS)
investigated in this work.
Lastly, we determine the bulk and shear moduli of the rock framework with the Hertz–Mindlin contact theory [49] and Hashin–Strikman
(H-S) lower bound [50] to account for pressure dependence effects of a
cyclic stress environment on the H2 -saturated porous rocks. In specific,
we compute the H-S rock frame moduli (𝐾𝐻𝑆 and 𝜇𝐻𝑆 ) based on

differential equation form [54] to absorb outgoing wavefields at the
domain boundaries, including the top boundary. Therefore, the generated data in our tests do not contain surface waves. In practice however,
depending on the complexity of near-surface conditions, surface waves
can possess strong energy that may leak into time-lapse waveforms.
In such a case, some careful data processing might be needed to
minimize the influence of surface waves on training and application
of HydrogenNet.

this work, all the fields in Eq. (18), including 𝐝leakage , 𝐝baseline , and 𝐰,
have the same dimension of 𝑁1 × 𝑁2 = 𝑁𝑡 × (𝑁𝑐 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑟 ) with 𝑁𝑡 = 256.
2.3. Network architecture of HydrogenNet and loss function
Our HydrogenNet is a lightweight, supervised NN that consists of
two parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) module and a dense
neural network (DNN) module connected by an adaptive average layer
in between. The architecture of HydrogenNet is displayed in Fig. 2.
The input to HydrogenNet is a single-channel 2D image with a size
of 𝑁𝑡 × 𝑁𝑐 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑟 , where 𝑁𝑡 = 256 represents the number of samples
along the temporal axis (the vertical dimension), 𝑁𝑐 is the number of
channels (2 for 2D case and 3 for 3D case), 𝑁𝑠 is the number of sources,
and 𝑁𝑟 is the number of monitoring stations. A relatively small value
of 𝑁𝑡 , 256, is adopted in this work to resample time-lapse waveforms
along the temporal axis. Our trial-and-error tests show that 𝑁𝑡 does
not play a significant role in impacting the inference accuracy, and
other values could be used as long as the resampled data can properly
represent the original time-lapse waveforms. However, larger 𝑁𝑡 can
lead to higher computational cost in both the training and validation
phases.

Fig. 6. Seismic data generated in the baseline UHS model displayed in Fig. 3. The
data contain two components (𝑣𝑥 on the left and 𝑣𝑧 on the right).

The input image then goes through a series of 2D convolutional
layers, where the numbers of features increase while the sizes of the
features decrease. Each of the convolutional layers is followed by a
rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation layer and a batch normalization
layer (e.g., [39]). The intermediate Conv units also include max pooling
layers with a kernel size of 2 to reduce the size of the features. The
feature maps are then transferred to an adaptive average pooling layer,
resulting in a feature map with a size of 𝑁 = 16 × 𝑁𝑐 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑟 ∕16 and
𝐶 = 256 channels.
The feature maps are then flattened and regressed by three dense
layers to six scalar values that represent the properties of a H2 leakage,

the leakage mass 𝑀, and the leakage volume 𝑉 . For 3D applications,
there are two additional properties, 𝑦min and 𝑦max , which describe the
spatial range of the leakage along the 𝑦-axis.
We use a 𝐿2 -norm loss function to train HydrogenNet:
 = (𝑦̂ − 𝑦)2 ,

We use a synthetic UHS model to validate the efficacy and accuracy
of our HydrogenNet. The 2D model, as displayed in Fig. 3, contains a
sandstone aquifer with 30% porosity at 1000 m deep and is approximately 100 m thick. Above the aquifer, there is a caprock that is 50 m
thick with a low porosity (5%). A UHS – a 50 m thick layer with an
80% saturation within the porous sandstone – is created in this model
by surface H2 injection. For the overlaying burden, we create a series
of layers with random thickness and porosity. In addition, we assume
an average geothermal temperature gradient in the crust of 20 ◦ C per
1000 m. For pressure, we assume an overlying atmospheric pressure
of 1 atm (i.e., 101,325 Pa) and an average density of 2450 kg/m3 . For
pore pressure, we use the standard hydrostatic pressure for fresh water,
i.e., 9.8 × 103 Pa/m.
Based on the quantitative relationship between H2 leakage and
elastic property changes in overburden rocks, we build 1000 leakage-

Because we use a sigmoid activation layer at the end of the regression
as displayed in Fig. 2, we normalize the ground-truth values, 𝑦, using
the model dimensions and the upper limits of 𝑀 and 𝑉 , respectively,
when preparing the training data. The strategy ensures the labels and
predictions are within in the range of [0, 1]. After prediction, we scale
the predicted values back to the physical domain to obtain interpretable
results.

stage models that contain simulated H2 leakage. The leakage in each
model has a random shape that is constructed using Bézier curves [55],
has a random location, and has a random size varying from 30 to
300 m. Fig. 4a–d show four of the 1000 random leakage models that
contain shallow to deep and small to large amount of H2 leakage
cases. Note that here the shape of the H2 leakage (or equivalently,
the induced medium parameter changes) is not computed through
the actual leakage-diffusion physics governing equation. However, the
randomness of these shapes is a proxy for us to mimic a wide range
of possibilities corresponding to actual leakage in a computationally
efficient way.
Using the elastic-wave equation solver described in the Methodology section, we generate the baseline seismic waveforms displayed
in Fig. 6, and leakage-stage seismic waveforms displayed in Fig. 7.
The wave energy, displayed as colorized absolute values of the timelapse waveform amplitude, evidently show that different leakages cause
different spatial–temporal distribution of time-lapse waveform energy
in the data. For instance, comparing Fig. 7b and d, we can know that
shallower leakage may cause the time-lapse waveform energy concentrating in the early arrivals. Comparing Fig. 7a and b, we can know
that a larger-area leakage causes more time-lapse waveform energy
difference w.r.t. the baseline data. These differences are essential for
HydrogenNet to learn the spatial–temporal characteristics of time-lapse
waveforms for leakage detection and characterization.
We generate time-lapse waveforms by subtracting the baseline
waveforms from the leakage-stage waveforms. The waveforms are then
resampled in the temporal domain and selected from the total 𝑁𝑐 ×
𝑁𝑠 × 𝑁𝑟 = 2 × 8 × 400 traces to compose the training data. In the
first test, we select four traces from each common-shot gather (CSG)
of each component of the time-lapse waveforms displayed in Fig. 7 to
form a subset of the time-lapse data. The subset therefore contains eight
CSGs, where each CSG contains fours traces, and each trace contains
two components (𝑣𝑥 and 𝑣𝑧 ).
Because of the linearity of small perturbation imaging in the context
of seismic migration, we perform time-lapse imaging directly using
the four time-lapse waveforms based on vector elastic reverse-time

migration (ERTM) [56]. Fig. 8a to d show the time-lapse images
associated with the four leakage models displayed in Fig. 5. Each of
these four images is a summation from eight CSG images. In addition,
we use black curves to indicate the ground-truth spatial locations of
leakages. It is evident that because there are only four traces in each
CSG, which is far below the data density requirement of conventional
imaging methods, the time-lapse images are full of strong, coherent
migration artifacts. Although in some cases (e.g., Fig. 8c), it is possible
to somehow interpret the location of leakage based on the amplitude of
the time-lapse image, in other cases, however, it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to perform reliable interpretation of the leakage location.
A natural question may arise by analyzing the results displayed in
Fig. 8: If we increase the number of seismic stations for time-lapse
seismic imaging, will we obtain a more interpretable image? Fig. 9
displays the time-lapse PP images generated using the data acquired
at all the 400 seismic receivers. That is, the data is 100 times denser
that those for generating the time-lapse images in Fig. 8. We display
the time-lapse images in a blue–red colormap while the ground-truth
locations of leakage using black curves. Although in this case imaging
artifacts are attenuated because of improved image stacking (more
receivers are equivalent to more sources according to the reciprocity
principle (e.g., [40])), determining the locations of leakage from these
images is still challenging. For instance, it is still impossible to tell
where the leakage is in Fig. 9b – there are at least two strong reflectors
in this image, one at approximately 0.7 km, the other at approximately
1.4 km. In addition, it is impossible to tell the horizontal range of
the leakage from this image. The other images have similar level of
interpretability. The results indicate that even with 100 times denser
data acquisition and by using state-of-the-art imaging method, it can
be challenging to determine the location of H2 leakage on time-lapse
seismic images generated based on sparse time-lapse data with high
fidelity.
By contrast, for our HydrogenNet method, we split the 1000 timelapse data into two groups: a training set that contains 900 data, and a
validation set that contains 100 data. There is no overlapping between
these two groups during training to ensure an unbiased training. We

result in Fig. 11a is too narrow and misses the ground truth, the
other predictions are in good agreement with the ground truth leakage
regions, even for the fourth leakage model where the leakage region is
very small. Regarding the leakage properties, the scaled ground-truth
leakage mass and volume for the first model (displayed in Fig. 5a) are

(𝑀,
predictions are (𝑀, 𝑉 ) = (3.255999 × 10−1 , 4.600800 × 10−1 ). We compare
the scaled ground-truth and prediction values for these four models
in Table 1. The results indicate that our HydrogenNet can produce
reasonably accurate estimation on the leakage mass and volume in
addition to the spatial location of leakage simultaneously.
Additionally, we display the HydrogenNet prediction results based
on 16 stations (i.e., 𝑁𝑟 = 16) for these four leakage models in Fig. 12.
With more stations and therefore more data for the training, the prediction accuracy improves over that associated with 𝑁𝑟 = 4, particularly
for the first and the fourth models. In fact, HydrogenNet produces
a very accurate estimation of leakage location for the first model as
displayed in Fig. 12a in both the vertical and horizontal directions. For
the fourth model, the estimated leakage range is visually identical to
the ground truth. The results evidently demonstrate that HydrogenNet
can estimate H2 leakage location using extremely sparse time-lapse
seismic data with a high accuracy, although it cannot delineate the
actual shape of a leakage.
To further investigate the efficacy and accuracy of HydrogenNet,
particularly the robustness to noise in the data, we perform the following series of tests for all the random leakage models and the associated
training and validation data.

train HydrogenNet using these data using an Adam optimizer [57] with
a learning rate of 1×10−5 . We display the loss convergence curves associated with the training and validation using blue solid and blue dashed
curves in Fig. 10. Each epoch of the training takes approximately 5 s on
a NVIDIA RTX 3090 graphics processing unit (GPU) card. The inference
phase for each input image takes approximately 0.0083 s (0.01 s for
the 𝑁𝑟 = 8 case and 0.015 s for the 𝑁𝑟 = 16 case), therefore can be
considered as real-time.
We display the HydrogenNet prediction results in Fig. 11 based on
a set of HydrogenNet weights trained using 𝑁𝑠 = 8, 𝑁𝑟 = 4, and
𝑁𝑐 = 2. We use blue regions to indicate the ground-truth leakages,
while red rectangles to indicate HydrogenNet predictions. Note that
HydrogenNet outputs four values (𝑥min , 𝑥max , 𝑧min , 𝑧max ) associated with
the leakage location based on our design, and these four values define a
rectangle (or a cuboid in 3D with six values). Except the first prediction

where 𝑦𝑖 are the estimated values, 𝑦̂𝑖 are the ground-truth values,
and 𝜇(𝑦)
̂ is the mean of the ground-truth values. 𝑅2 = 0 means no
correlation between predicted and ground-truth values, while 𝑅2 = 1
indicates a perfect correlation.
We find that for the training dataset, all the six 𝑅2 scores are
high (close to 1), indicating a successful training. The more important
implication of the successful training is that there exists a definitive
mapping (although perhaps highly nonlinear) between the time-lapse
waveforms and the six quantities that define a H2 leakage scenario. For
the validation data that are not in the training dataset, we observe good
consistency between the ground-truth values and HydrogenNet inference results. The accuracy of the predictions for different parameters
are 𝑥min , 𝑥max > 𝑧min , 𝑧max > 𝑀, 𝑉 . We can interpret the results from an
intuitive point of view: Because we use surface seismic data as training
data, the estimation of leakage range in the horizontal direction can
generally be better than that in the vertical direction. Given another
type of observation system (e.g., vertical seismic profiling system),
the result could be reversed. Meanwhile, the estimation of spatial
range of H2 leakage is better than that of leakage mass or volume,
because leakage mass and volume change medium properties more
‘‘implicitly’’ than the leakage range – a different leakage range usually
results in very different time-lapse waveforms in either amplitude
or spatial characteristics of energy distribution. A different leakage
mass/volume, however, may not necessarily correspond to strikingly

different medium property changes that result in sufficient time-lapse
waveform changes.
We now train and validate HydrogenNet using noisy time-lapse
data. Fig. 14a–c display three examples of noisy data in the training
dataset, to which we add a mild level of Gaussian random noise to the
noise-free data displayed in Fig. 13a–c by drawing 𝜆 from a uniform
random distribution  (0, 13 ) for different training data, where 0 and 13
are the lower and upper bound of this uniform distribution. Fig. 14d
and e display the training and validation results associated with these
weakly noisy data. Judging from the 𝑅2 scores associated with the
inferences for the training and validation data, we again find that the
accuracy of inferences follows a similar pattern to the noise-free case:
𝑥min , 𝑥max > 𝑧min , 𝑧max > 𝑀, 𝑉 , but in this case the differences among
the three tiers are larger. By adding a higher level of random noise to
the data where we draw 𝜆 from a uniform random distribution  ( 13 , 23 )
for different training data, we obtain the training and validation results
displayed in Fig. 15. Note that the noise level in this case is very
high, making it difficult or even impossible to identify the effective
time-lapse signals using visual inspection, as are shown in Fig. 15a–
c. Not surprisingly, the 𝑅2 scores in this case are worse than those
in Fig. 14, especially for the leakage mass and volume estimations.
Nevertheless, we still observe an accurate estimation of the horizontal
range of leakage, and a decent estimation of the vertical range of

results with 𝑁𝑟 = 8 stations. Compared with the case of 𝑁𝑟 = 4
displayed in Fig. 13, we find the inference accuracy of all the six
parameters of the validation dataset is improved. This is consistent with
our intuition: more seismic data and therefore more data provide better
constraints in learning and inference, leading to better generalization.
Higher data density also results in improved accuracy for noisy data
as shown in Figs. 18 and 19. The inference accuracy can be further
improved by using 𝑁𝑟 = 16 traces (therefore a total of 256 traces of
waveforms), as displayed in Figs. 21–23. With 𝑁𝑟 = 16, our HydrogenNet can generate high-accuracy estimation for all the six parameters
even with strong noise in the training data.
Again, we display the bar charts of misfits associated with the six
parameters of the validation dataset in the noise-free, mildly noisy,
and strongly noisy cases in Fig. 20a, b, and c, respectively, which
are consistent with the correlation plots in Figs. 17d, 18d, and 19d,
respectively. The influence of random noise on the inference results
resembles that in the 𝑁𝑟 = 4 case displayed in Fig. 16.
We further display the distribution of misfits associated with the six
parameters of the validation dataset in the noise-free, mildly noisy, and
strongly noisy cases in Fig. 24a, b, and c, respectively, consistent with
the correlation analyses in Figs. 21c, 22c, and 23c, respectively. Again,
an increased level of random noise deteriorates the inference accuracy.
However, compared with the error distributions displayed in Figs. 16

built upon the hybrid 2D CNN and DNN architecture.
We display the distribution of misfits associated with the six parameters of the validation dataset in the noise-free, mildly noisy and
strongly noisy cases in Fig. 16a, b, and c, respectively. These distributions are consistent with the correlation plots in Figs. 13e, 14e, and
15e, respectively. In all the three cases, the predictions of horizontal
range are the best, while the predictions of vertical range are less
accurate as manifested by a wider range of error distribution. The
predictions of leakage mass and volume are the worst and have the
widest error distribution. The maximum error appears in the volume
prediction, which is 0.254. We consider this deviation being acceptable
in this multi-value regression problem due to the complexity of timelapse waveforms. In these plots, we also √
display the fitted Gaussian in
the form of 𝑓 (𝑥) = exp[−(𝑥 − 𝜇)2 ∕2𝜎 2 ]∕𝜎 2𝜋 of the prediction errors,
where a wider Gaussian indicates a larger standard deviation 𝜎 (thus
less accurate predictions) and vice versa. We observe that for each
parameter, stronger noise in the data will result in wider Gaussian
(poorer prediction), while the prediction of horizontal leakage range
has narrower Gaussian (better prediction) than that associated with the
vertical range, leakage mass, and leakage volume.
We now investigate how the number of permanent seismic stations
affect the training and inference accuracy of HydrogenNet. Fig. 17 displays two examples of noise-free training data, training and validation

and 20, it is straightforward to find that more permanent stations result
in an improved inference accuracy.
To summarize the results, we use Table 2 to compare the 𝑅2 scores
of different validation datasets in the above tests. The values marked
by a bond font indicate the best 𝑅2 scores under different noise levels.
It is evident that by using more stations, the inference accuracy can
be improved. Meanwhile, a higher noise level in the training data can
result in reduced accuracy in the generalization phase.

4. Discussions
The proceeding section has demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of our ML method for detecting and characterizing H2 leakage
from UHS based on very sparse seismic data. Note that by conventional seismic imaging/inversion methods, it is possible to delineate
the actual shape the time-lapse changes of Earth medium induced by
H2 leakage, but it usually requires dense data coverage to achieve
sufficient accuracy and interpretability. By HydrogenNet, however, it
is only possible to know the location (measured as min–max range
values) and leakage properties of a leakage, yet we have demonstrated
that it requires significantly sparser data coverage than conventional
seismic imaging/inversion methods to achieve reliable leakage location
and characterization. We summarize the advantages and disadvantages
of HydrogenNet compared with conventional imaging and inversion
methods in Table 3.

It is curious to know if there are alternative or even better ML
architectures to HydrogenNet developed in this work for the H2 leakage detection and characterization problem. While there are many

ML models that can perform multi-value regression, a straightforward
alternative may consider a time-lapse seismic waveform as a 1D time
series, rather than a 2D image as in our HydrogenNet. In other words,
one could design an architecture as displayed in Fig. 25, where the
input is a 2D tensor with a size of 256 and a total of 𝑁𝑐 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑟 channels,
instead of a 3D tensor with a size of 256 × (𝑁𝑐 𝑁𝑠 𝑁𝑟 ) but with one
channel input to HydrogenNet as displayed in Fig. 2. In such a case,
the CNN part in this 1D variant of HydrogenNet is a 1D CNN instead
of 2D CNN. For convenience, we name this NN the HydrogenNet-1D.
We now train and validate HydrogenNet-1D using the same training
and validation datasets as for HydrogenNet. We only choose the case
noise-free data with 𝑁𝑟 = 4 for a comparison. Fig. 26a and b display the
correlation between the ground-truth and predicted parameter values
and the statistics of parameter prediction errors associated with the
validation dataset, respectively. While the predictions of the vertical
range (𝑧min and 𝑧max ) have the same level of accuracy compared with
HydrogenNet as displayed in Fig. 13e, the accuracy associated with
the predictions of horizontal range, mass, and volume is notably lower

compared with that associated with HydrogenNet. For instance, using HydrogenNet, the 𝑅2 scores associated with 𝑥min and 𝑥max are
higher than 0.99 and close to 1 (perfect prediction), while the scores
are merely 0.916 and 0.896 using HydrogenNet-1D. Meanwhile, the
distributions of misfits generated by HydrogenNet-1D as displayed in
Fig. 26b are notably wider than those generated by HydrogenNet
as displayed in Fig. 16a, especially for 𝑥min , 𝑥max , 𝑀 and 𝑉 . The
results indicate that with the same dataset, HydrogenNet is more
accurate in predicting the spatial location and leakage properties compared with HydrogenNet-1D. The reason behind this difference could
be qualitatively analyzed: HydrogenNet leverages 2D CNN to learn
the spatial features embedded in the time-lapse seismic waveforms,
while HydrogenNet-1D focuses more on the temporal features of the
waveforms. As indicated by the data plots in Fig. 7 using colors,
HydrogenNet-1D may miss important information embedded in the
spatial pattern of time-lapse waveforms, which by contrast can be
exploited by our HydrogenNet to capture the characteristics of waveform changes induced by H2 leakage and improve the accuracy of

NN architectures can also perform the learning and prediction from
time-lapse waveform data. However, a thorough comparison among all
these possible architectures is not the focus of this work.

the first systematic study that focuses on applying machine learning
to subsurface H2 leakage detection and characterization and could
potentially serve as a cost-effective geophysical tool for underground
hydrogen leakage detection and characterization with high fidelity.

5. Conclusions
Declaration of competing interest
We have developed a novel supervised machine learning method
to detect and characterize H2 leakage from underground hydrogen
storage. We use a 2D convolutional neural network module along with
a dense neural network module to construct the supervised machine
learning model. The input to this neural network is a set of spatially
sparse time-lapse seismic waveforms, while the output from the neural
network includes six scalar values that describe the spatial and physical
properties of a H2 leakage. To generate high-quality training data, we
develop a novel rock physics model to accurately quantify the relations
among the elastic properties (including the elastic wave velocities and
mass density), leakage mass, and leakage volume. We generate timelapse waveforms based on the first-order stress-velocity elastic-wave
equations and train the neural network using the resample data with or
without random noise. We compare the training and validation results
for different datasets and find that higher data density generally results
in improved inference accuracy, while a higher level of noise in the
training data can reduce the inference accuracy. Our investigation is
