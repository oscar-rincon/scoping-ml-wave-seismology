Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.","2024-07-25","2024-09-04 19:57:13","2024-09-16 05:02:33","2024-09-04 19:57:13","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 27 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BVERLUKC\Huang et al. - 2024 - Diffusion-based subsurface multiphysics monitoring.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G6GPXBWN\2407.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2407.18426","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The size of the system almost exponentially increases with the demand for higher resolution images in complicated subsurface media. We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach that leverages the existing physics-based models and machine learning optimizers to achieve more accurate and cheaper solutions.

These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions.

However, Monte Carlo techniques are computationally expensive since they require repeated solution of the wave equation for each proposed velocity model. One approach to reduce the computational expense is two-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), wherein a computationally inexpensive filter is used to quickly reject unacceptable models. This filter reduces the number of models that must be tested using the full fine-grid forward solver. Often, coarse-grid formulations of the forward problems are used in the filter stage. We instead use a neural network to replace the expensive computation of the residual directly. In addition, we train the neural network as part of the MCMC process, bypassing the need to generate separate training data outside of the MCMC process. We find that the neural network two-stage MCMC (NNMCMC) substantially reduces the time-per-trial and time-per-rejection by 65% and 84%, respectively, when compared with the one-stage MCMC. Furthermore, NNMCMC increases the acceptance rate to 86% from 29% over the one-stage MCMC. © 2019 SEG","2020","2024-08-24 16:40:56","2024-08-28 00:05:44","","1670-1674","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","58 - Duplicado","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\PKHJLESA\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\2A3XQSIE\Stuart et al. - 2020 - Enhanced neural network sampling for two-stage Mar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEG International Exposition and Annual Meeting 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method uses the wave-equation inversion kernel to invert the skeletonized data that is automatically learned by an autoencoder. The skeletonised data is a one-dimensional latent-space representation of the seismic trace. However, for a complicated dataset, the decoded waveform could lose some details if the latent space dimension is set to one, which leads to a low-resolution NML tomogram. To mitigate this problem, an autoencoder with a higher dimensional latent space is needed to encode and decode the seismic data. In this paper, we present a wave equation inversion that inverts the multi-dimensional latent variables of an autoencoder for the subsurface velocity model. The multi-variable implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the multi-dimensional skeletonised data with respect to the velocity perturbations. In this case, each dimension of the latent variable is characterized one gradient and the velocity model is updated by the weighted sum of all these gradients. Numerical results suggest that the multidimensional NML inverted result can achieve a higher resolution in the tomogram compared to the conventional single dimensional NML inversion. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","2020","2024-08-24 17:38:08","2024-08-26 17:23:45","","1691-1694","","","2020-October","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","84 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UTM9WKE4\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\JY8HQM28\Chen et al. - 2020 - Seismic inversion by multi-dimensional newtonian m.pdf","","","Machine learning; Inversion; Wave equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, first arrivals can be compressed in a low-rank sense with their skeletal features extracted by a well-trained autoencoder. Empirical experiments suggest that the autoencoder's 1× 1 or 2× 1 latent vectors vary continuously with respect to the input seismic data. It is, therefore, reasonable to introduce a misfit functional measuring the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed data in a low-dimensional latent space. The benefit of this approach is that an elaborated autoencoding neural network not only refines intrinsic information hidden in the refractions but also improves the quality of inversion for a reliable background velocity model. Numerical tests on both synthetic and field data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, especially in recovering the low-to-intermediate wavenumber parts of the subsurface velocity distribution. Comparisons are made with the other three relevant methods, the wave-equation travel-time (WT) inversion, the envelope inversion, and the full waveform inversion (FWI). As expected, the cycle skipping problem is alleviated due to the reduction of dimensions of data space. This method outperforms the envelope inversion in resolution, and it is no worse than WT. Moreover, there is no need for careful manual travel-time picking with this methodology. In general, this inversion framework provides an extendable strategy to compress any input data for reconstructing high-dimensional physical parameters. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","2021","2024-08-24 17:35:13","2024-08-26 17:22:32","","8210-8227","","10","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","82 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\8PQV3WCD\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\PQFQBXPP\Yu et al. - 2021 - Skeletonized Wave-Equation Refraction Inversion wi.pdf","","","Autoencoder; refractions; skeletonization; waveform inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion. However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network (NN) parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the NN with a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source at the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach. © 2021 The Authors","2021","2024-08-24 17:22:32","2024-08-26 16:43:49","","11-19","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","72 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\Q6LF4KDN\Alkhalifah et al. - 2021 - Wavefield solutions from machine learned functions.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NTJCFYEJ\display.html","","","Neural networks; Deep learning; Helmholtz equation; Modeling; Wavefields","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contribution of Newtonian noise is site specific and depends on the ambient seismic field which in turn depends on the site’s geology and the distribution of surface and underground seismic-noise sources. We have investigated the application of machine learning in combination with the deployment of seismic sensor networks to predict seismic displacement noise at specific locations on the surface and underground. Moreover we have modeled a deep neural network (DNN) that allows to subtract Newtonian noise from the strain data measured by Einstein Telescope. The seismic-field model is based on a complete solution of the elastodynamic wave equations for a horizontally-layered soil structure. The geology features soft-soil layers on hard-rock and was shown to be effective in attenuating Newtonian noise from surface waves below the required sensitivity. In addition our model includes a random background of body waves with all possible angles of incidence. We show that a DNN is effective in predicting Newtonian noise. Application of our DNN allows Newtonian noise subtraction by a factor up to 4.7 at 1 Hz and 2.5 at 5 Hz. © 2023 The Author(s).

New sets of the second order viscoacoustic and viscoelastic anisotropic wave equations are established with the new recursive temporal convolutions, which completely replaces the traditional auxiliary differential equations of the memory variables.

The acoustic wave equation (AWE) is often used for studying wave propagation in both fluids and solids and is crucial for many applications including seismic imaging and inversion and non-destructive testing. Because analytical AWE solutions rarely exist for complex heterogeneous media, methods for generating numerical AWE solutions are very desirable. Traditional numerical solvers require discrete model representations with many restrictions placed on the shape and spacing of grid elements. This work uses a relatively new class of numerical solvers known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that provide a mesh-free alternative for generating AWE solutions using a deep neural-network framework. We encapsulate a time-domain AWE formulation within a loss function that is used to train network parameters. The initial conditions are implemented by enforcing hard constraints on the neural network instead of including them as separate loss-function terms. We also use a Fourier neural network (FNN) to alleviate the spectral bias commonly observed when using fully connected neural network in the conventional PINN approach. Numerical tests on both 2D homogeneous and heterogeneous velocity models confirm the accuracy of our approach. We observe that using FNNs helps in the convergence of AWE solutions especially for heterogeneous models. We compare PINN-based solutions with those computed by the highly accurate conventional pseudo-spectral method, and observe that the normalized energy differences between the two sets of solutions were less than 4% for all numerical tests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2023","2024-08-24 16:37:18","2024-08-26 15:21:49","","737-751","","5","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","54 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\4DQI2I7K\Sethi et al. - 2023 - Hard enforcement of physics-informed neural networ.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\K4Y9AI94\display.html","","","Neural networks; Wave propagation; Acoustic; Physics informed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is of great significance to analyze the noise properties and establish accurate noise models. Since the complex changes of the actual medium seriously affect propagation characteristics, it is necessary to establish a noise model in a more realistic medium. In this letter, we suppose a weakly heterogeneous medium whose properties vary with the position. And the link between the Lam constants of the medium and noise properties is established. Therefore, a wave equation is deduced in that medium to describe the propagation law of desert seismic exploration random noise. Based on the Greens function, the random noise field is obtained by superimposing all wave fields excited by each pointlike source. Afterward, quantitative comparisons between the actual random noise and the proposed random noise model are given. The results manifest that there are significant similarities in mathematical characteristics between them. Moreover, compared with the noise model in the homogeneous medium, the proposed noise model is more reliable. In order to prove the application value of the random noise model, it is first applied to construct a complete training set for denoising convolutional neural networks, which is valuable for attenuating the desert seismic exploration random noise. This is an effective way to extend noise data. Consequently, this feasible application will strongly promote the application of neural networks in seismic exploration. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","2020","2024-08-24 16:30:49","2024-08-26 06:20:21","","701-705","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","47 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\6JVJUZUQ\Feng et al. - 2020 - Modeling Land Seismic Exploration Random Noise in .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\QJ8YXDBG\display.html","","","Denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN); seismic exploration random noise modeling; training set; wave equations in the heterogeneous medium; weakly heterogeneous isotropic medium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a deep-learning denoising method to suppress the random noise in different areas based on convolutional neural network (CNN). For a certain area, we leverage the wave equation and power spectrum analysis to construct a noise set whose DF distribution is close to that of the real random noise in this area, and then a CNN denoising model for this area can be obtained via the training of this noise set. In addition, an energy ratio factor is used to adjust the energy ratio of effective signal patch and noise patch in the training process, so as to improve the generalization ability of CNN denoising model to different SNRs.

However, the diffraction energy tends to be weak compared to the reflected energy and is also sensitive to inaccuracies in the migration velocity, making the identification of its signal challenging. In this work, we present an innovative workflow to automatically detect scattering points in the migration dip angle domain using deep learning. By taking advantage of the different kinematic properties of reflected and diffracted waves, we separate the two types of signals by migrating the seismic amplitudes to dip angle gathers using prestack depth imaging in the local angle domain. Convolutional neural networks are a class of deep learning algorithms able to learn to extract spatial information about the data in order to identify its characteristics. They have now become the method of choice to solve supervised pattern recognition problems. In this work, we use wave equation modelling to create a large and diversified dataset of synthetic examples to train a network into identifying the probable position of scattering objects in the subsurface. After giving an intuitive introduction to diffraction imaging and deep learning and discussing some of the pitfalls of the methods, we evaluate the trained network on field data and demonstrate the validity and good generalization performance of our algorithm. We successfully identify with a high-accuracy and high-resolution diffraction points, including those which have a low signal to noise and reflection ratio.

To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the impedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as the model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media, where the impedance matrix is far more complex. In addition, the conventional finite-difference method produces numerical dispersion artefacts in solving acoustic wave equations for anisotropic media. To address these issues, we use the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain wavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of automatic differentiation to calculate their partial derivatives, which are free of numerical dispersion artefacts. Thus, we use the wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide functional solutions to the acoustic VTI form of the wave equation. Instead of predicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered pressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point-source singularity. We use the spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real and imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After training a deep neural network, we can evaluate the wavefield at any point in space almost instantly using this trained neural network without calculating the impedance matrix inverse. We demonstrate these features on a simple 2-D anomaly model and a 2-D layered model. Additional tests on a modified 3-D Overthrust model and a 2-D model with irregular topography further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Seismic properties and well-log data are essential to establish wave-propagation models. Specifically, the description of wave dispersion and attenuation under complex geological conditions needs proper lithological and petrophysical information. This complex physical mechanism has to be considered if a traditional modeling approach is adopted. In this sense, machine learning (ML) techniques provide new possibilities for this purpose. We compare two deep-neural-network (DNN)-based wave propagation models. In the first (pure data-driven), a DNN is trained to connect seismic attributes, such as wave velocities, to multivariate functions of rock-physics properties. By training DNNs with different initial parameters, the uncertainty of the proposed method can be quantified. The second method assumes the form of the wave equations. Then, the elastic constants of the constitutive relations are predicted by DNNs. The resulting dynamical equations describe the dispersion and attenuation and wavefield simulations can be performed to obtain more information. On the basis of a test, the two kinds of wave-propagation models yield acceptable estimations of the seismic properties, with the second approach showing a broader application because the DNN is trained without S wave data. The methodologies illustrate that the new wave-propagation model based on ML has high precision and can be general in terms of rheological description. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder consists of seismic traces, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the Fréchet derivative, i.e., the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The gradient is computed by migrating the shifted observed traces weighted by the skeletonized data residual, and the final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. We denote this as inversion by Newtonian machine learning (NML) because it inverts for the model parameters by combining the forward and backward modeling of Newtonian wave propagation with the dimensional reduction capability of machine learning. Empirical results suggest that inversion by NML can sometimes mitigate the cycle-skipping problem of conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI). Numerical tests with synthetic and field data demonstrate the success of NML inversion in recovering a low-wavenumber approximation to the subsurface velocity model. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The disadvantage is that the inverted velocity model has less resolution compared with the FWI result, but it can serve as a good initial model for FWI. Our most significant contribution is that we provide a general framework for using wave-equation inversion to invert skeletal data generated by any type of neural network. In other words, we have combined the deterministic modeling of Newtonian physics and the pattern matching capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by NML. © The Authors.","2020","2024-08-24 16:10:27","2024-08-26 05:45:27","","WA185-WA200","","4","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","36 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\6HE7UY2C\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TTUAZD39\Chen y Schuster - 2020 - Seismic inversion by Newtonian machine learning.pdf","","","machine learning; inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, numerical solutions are susceptible to dispersion artifacts, and they often require considerable computational resources. Moreover, their accuracy is dependent on the size of discretization, which is a function of the operating frequency. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated the potential to tackle long-standing challenges in seismic modeling and inversion, addressing the associated computational bottleneck and numerical dispersion artifacts. Despite progress, PINNs exhibit spectral bias, resulting in a stronger capability to learn low-frequency features over high-frequency ones. This paper proposes the use of a simple fully-connected PINN model, and evaluates its potential to interpolate and extrapolate scattered wavefields that correspond to the acoustic VTI wave equation across multiple frequencies. The issue of spectral bias is tackled by incorporating the Kronecker neural network architecture with composite activation function formed using the inverse tangent (atan), exponential linear unit (elu), locally adaptive sine (l-sin), and locally adaptive cosine (l-cos) activation functions. This allows the construction of an effectively wider neural network with a minimal increase in the number of trainable parameters. The proposed scheme keeps the network size fixed for multiple frequencies and does not require repeated training at each frequency.

Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods. Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location, particularly in large 3D models.

There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known. In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies. With this database, we show that the FNO can produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. Intensity measures at moderate and large periods are especially well reproduced. We present the first seismological application of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D. Thanks to the generalizability of our database, we believe that our model can be used to assess the influence of geological features such as sedimentary basins on ground motion, which is paramount to evaluating site effects. © 2023 UNCECOMP Proceedings.

Traditional inversion methods from field-recorded seismograms struggle in regions with complex geology. While deep learning (DL) presents a promising alternative, its robustness using field data in these complicated regions has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we present a thorough analysis of DL’s capability to harness labeled seismograms, whether field-recorded or synthetically generated, for accurate velocity model recovery in a challenging region of the Gulf of Mexico. Our evaluation centers on the impact of training data selection and data augmentation techniques on the DL model’s ability to recover velocity profiles. Models trained on field data produced superior results to data obtained using quantitative metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and (Formula presented.) (R-squared). They also yielded more geologically plausible predictions and sharper geophysical migration images. Conversely, models trained on synthetic data, while less precise, highlighted the potential utility of synthetic training data, especially when labeled field data are scarce. Our work shows that the efficacy of synthetic data-driven models largely depends on bridging the domain gap between training and test data through the use of advanced wave equation solvers and geologic priors. Our results underscore DL’s potential to advance velocity model-building workflows in industrial settings using previously labeled field-recorded seismograms. They also highlight the indispensable role of earth scientists’ domain expertise in curating synthetic data when field data are lacking. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-08-28 15:42:25","2024-09-04 21:08:54","","","","19","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","99 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VGF6MCFD\display.html","","","deep learning; inverse problems; field data; seismic propagation velocity; synthetic training data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.","2021-06-02","2024-09-04 19:50:49","2024-09-04 20:20:26","2024-09-04 19:50:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 18 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\U3BDXEDM\Alkhalifah et al. - 2021 - Wavefield solutions from machine learned functions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advancement of deep learning enables solving partial differential equations, including wave equations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the inputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We also propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Moreover, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets than the traditional finite-difference method.

The single-dimensional LS features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder network. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details. To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features, which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote this method as multi-dimensional Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we define a new multi-variable connective function that works together with the multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity perturbations to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that (1) the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than the single-dimensional LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional LS features, and the inversion quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires a much smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored. The disadvantage of MNML is that it can more easily get stuck in local minima compared to the NML method. So we suggest a multiscale inversion approach that inverts for higher dimensional LS features as the iteration count increase.","2021-12-16","2024-09-04 19:55:52","2024-09-04 20:17:21","2024-09-04 19:55:52","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 24 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\9DLSX4TM\Chen y Saygin - 2021 - Seismic Inversion by Multi-dimensional Newtonian M.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\FRN9XKHU\2112.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2112.08629","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the proposed framework, two feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked with reconstructing the seismic data, whilst an auxiliary, smaller network estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (coarsely sampled) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and pre-computed local slopes. We find that introducing a second network to estimate the local slopes whilst at the same time interpolating the aliased data enhances the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the primary network.

In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions and $\sim 100$ times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation.

The DL feature is a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional seismic data, which is automatically generated by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and preserved in the latent space. The low-dimensional DL feature contains the key information of the input seismic data. Therefore, instead of directly comparing the waveform differences between the observed and predicted data, such as full-waveform inversion (FWI). We measure their DL feature differences in the latent space of a CAE. The advantage of this low-dimensional comparison is that it is less prone to the cycle-skipping problem compared to FWI. The reason is that the DL features mainly contain the kinematic information, such as traveltime, of the input seismic data when the latent space dimension is small. However, more dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, can be preserved in the DL feature when the latent space dimension becomes larger. Therefore we propose a multiscale inversion approach that starts with inverting the low-dimensional DL features for the low-wavenumber information of the subsurface model. Then recover its high-wavenumber details through inverting the high-dimensional DL features. However, there is no governing equation that contains both the velocity and DL feature terms in the same equation. Therefore we use the automatic differentiation (AD) to numerically connect the perturbation of DL features to the velocity perturbation. In another word, we connect a deep learning network with the wave-equation inversion by using the AD. We denote this hybrid connection as hybrid machine learning (HML) inversion.

Comparing activation functions in solving the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks","","","","10.48550/arXiv.2110.07721","http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07721","Solving the wave equation numerically constitutes the majority of the computational cost for applications like seismic imaging and full waveform inversion. An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz equation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated modeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility to model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up computations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved convergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved performance on a number of data science problems. Through a comparative study, we find that swish yields superior performance compared to the other activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature.","2021-10-11","2024-09-04 19:46:17","2024-09-04 20:04:17","2024-09-04 19:46:17","","","","","","","Is it time to swish?","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 12 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KXDW85H5\Al-Safwan et al. - 2021 - Is it time to swish Comparing activation function.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BTBCRR46\2110.html","","","Physics - Computational Physics; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2110.07721","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those of the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it provides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert skeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and their skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their perturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features.

Traditional inversion methods from field-recorded seismograms struggle in regions with complex geology. While deep learning (DL) presents a promising alternative, its robustness using field data in these complicated regions has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we present a thorough analysis of DL’s capability to harness labeled seismograms, whether field-recorded or synthetically generated, for accurate velocity model recovery in a challenging region of the Gulf of Mexico. Our evaluation centers on the impact of training data selection and data augmentation techniques on the DL model’s ability to recover velocity profiles. Models trained on field data produced superior results to data obtained using quantitative metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and (Formula presented.)

Conversely, models trained on synthetic data, while less precise, highlighted the potential utility of synthetic training data, especially when labeled field data are scarce. Our work shows that the efficacy of synthetic data-driven models largely depends on bridging the domain gap between training and test data through the use of advanced wave equation solvers and geologic priors.

For a layered subsurface, these eigenfunctions provide a framework to calculate guided-wave properties at a fraction of the time required for fully numerical approaches for wave-equation modeling, such as the finite-difference approach. Using a 1D velocity model representing the low-velocity Eagle Ford Shale, an unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir, we verify the accuracy of the displacement eigenfunctions by comparing with finite-difference modeling. We use the amplitude portion of the Green's function for source-receiver eigenfunction pairs as a proxy for expected guided-wave amplitude. These response functions are used to investigate the impact of velocity contrast, reservoir thickness, and receiver depth on guided-wave amplitudes for discrete frequencies. We find that receivers located within the low-velocity zone record larger guided-wave amplitudes. This property may be used to infer the location of the recording array in relation to the low-velocity reservoir. We also study guided-wave energy distribution between the different layers of the Eagle Ford model and find that most of the high-frequency energy is confined to the low-velocity reservoir. We corroborate this measurement with field microseismic data recorded by DAS (distributed acoustic sensing) fiber installed outside of the Eagle Ford. The data contain high-frequency body-wave energy, but the guided waves are confined to low frequencies since the recording array is outside the waveguide. We also study the energy distribution between the fundamental and first guided-wave modes as a function of frequency and source depth and find a nodal point in the first mode for source depths originating in the middle of the low-velocity zone, which we validate with the same field data.

Therefore, we propose a data-driven deep-learning (DL)-P/S-VD method that eliminates the need for prior elastic parameter information. We used publicly available elastic models to generate training datasets by simulating multicomponent data and their amplitude-preserving P-/S-wave components using the decoupled elastic wave equation.

Moreover, DL-PSVD exhibits improved generalization ability using four channels for observed data with removed direct waves. Finally, the L1 loss function is more effective for DL-PSVD's generalization ability than the L2 loss function.

In this paper, we present a novel Machine Learning based data processing method to generate accurate seismic profiles. Through this method, the processing of humongous acoustic data and subsequent inference of subsurface properties is significantly expedited. The work being presented is an application of a recently developed novel class of algorithms called the Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The method has been proven in its efficacy for approximating the solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDE) governing complex physical phenomena and in data-driven discovery of the underlying PDEs such as the Navier-Stokes system. Herein, we have followed a two-stage procedure. Stage one is the accurate prediction of spatiotemporal propagation of a seismic pulse through a simulated domain resembling thesubsurface. For this we developed a simulator to generate vast amounts of virtual seismic data. Dense Deep Neural Networks (DNN) were used to overfit the data so that it approximates the solution to the wave equations. This was followed by the data-driven discovery of local velocities in different reflector layers. In the second stage, we have extended the algorithm to infer the real subsurface velocity profile based on the data collected at receiver positions during an actual seismic survey from Volve, a field on the Norwegian continental shelf. Moreover, we have bench-marked and established the performance of various models in their ability to learn the receiver data obtained from a simulated 2D seismic survey. The results are promising as the network chosen can learn the receiver data with a minimal number of iterations and with near-perfect accuracy. The models were further tested in their ability to represent solutions of the wave equation in the spatiotemporal domain and in their ability to represent the actual subsurface velocity profiles. The novelty of this paper lies in the overlap of a nascent-stage deep learning tool, called PINNs, with seismic data processing to expedite and improvise high-resolution subsurface imaging. For this, various other uncommon developments were done such as that of adapting PINN as a dynamic wave function approximator. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by the excellent accuracy obtained when validated against the velocity profile from the field as well as the velocity profile from the simulator. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers","2020","2024-08-24 16:42:10","2024-09-02 15:42:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","60 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ERYVQ9BN\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is time consuming if many frequencies are involved for solving the linear wave equations, particularly, for large 3D velocity models. We propose accelerating the modeling by applying deep learning. Because similarity appears among the wavefields in near frequencies, we can extract similar features and reconstruct the unknown wavefields by deep learning. We compute fewer frequency-domain wavefields with a large frequency interval by conventional modeling methods, such as finite-difference methods, and then interpolate more frequency-domain wavefields with a small frequency interval by applying deep learning. Numerical examples demonstrate that the U-Net, which is trained by the data on 10 2D simple-layered models, can be used to interpolate the data on SEG Advanced Modeling models and also can be used to interpolate the data on the 3D layered model and 3D overthrust model. A series of tests on perturbation models prove that the U-Net performance is still good when the root-mean-square value of the velocity model perturbation relative to the initial model is up to 15%. Compared with traditional modeling methods, the computational time of interpolating by applying deep learning is negligible, especially for 3D models. After the network is trained, the acceleration strategy helps to reduce the runtime by approximately 50% for a modeling problem because the U-Net can be used to interpolate 50% of the data that would otherwise need to be modeled. Although training the model will take some time, good generalization of the U-Net, especially for 3D problems, enhances its benefits on the application for frequency-domain forward modeling. © 2022 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","2022","2024-08-24 16:41:36","2024-09-02 15:37:12","","T315-T328","","4","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","59 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\RIH8GKFV\Cao et al. - 2022 - Accelerating 2D and 3D frequency-domain seismic wa.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VUF6CY2V\display.html","","","machine learning; frequency domain; modeling; finite difference; interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a small-data-driven time-domain method for fast seismic simulations in complex media based on the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (FNO). Unlike most DL-based modeling schemes that either solve wave equations by embedding the physical constraints into the cost function or conduct physics-informed learning by incorporating the wave functions into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the FNO uses a learning architecture similar to the structure of split-step Fourier wave propagators, which is composed of two CNNs formulated in the space and wavenumber domains, respectively. The space-domain CNN acts as a local trainable phase-screen compensation. The wavenumber-domain CNN represents a nonlocal spatial convolutional operator acting as a trainable wavenumber filter for the phase-shift process. The FNO method approximates the mathematical-physical behavior of wave equations through learning the mapping between seismic wavefields at different time/locations from training seismic data. That is, the learning process parameterizes the integral kernel directly in the Fourier space, so that we can establish an expressive and efficient architecture for a better balance between accuracy and performance than the traditional spatial CNNs. Applications to gradient, layered, and Marmousi velocity models demonstrate its performance in accuracy and efficiency. The FNO seismic simulation is a data-driven method that needs a small amount of training data, especially when using blended source training data. It is a discretization-independent method that is not subject to the limitation of spatial sampling and time steps imposed on traditional numerical solvers, implying that the training data can be discretized arbitrarily. It also is a model-independent method that can include absorption attenuation into seismic modeling without the need of viscoelastic wave equations.","2022","2024-07-24 21:50:24","2024-09-02 15:17:21","","","","6","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","23 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\B9KQGJJB\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\EKTRHAML\Wei y Fu - 2022 - Small-data-driven fast seismic simulations for com.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Like functions, PINNs are formed by using a fully connected neural network (NN) to provide the wavefield solution at spatial points in the domain of interest, in which the coordinates of the point form the input to the network. We train such a network by backpropagating the misfit in the wave equation for the output wavefield values and their derivatives for many points in the model space. Generally, a hyperbolic tangent activation is used with PINNs, however, we use an adaptive sinusoidal activation function to optimize the training process. Numerical results show that PINNs with adaptive sinusoidal activation functions are able to generate frequency-domain wavefield solutions that satisfy wave equations. We also show the flexibility and versatility of the proposed method for various media, including anisotropy, and for models with strong irregular topography.","2022-03-01","2024-02-26 22:05:58","2024-09-02 14:58:45","2024-02-26 15:21:04","1750-1762","","3","228","","Geophysical Journal International","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","12 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\X99D5U55\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3RRBAM3N\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XN57MPKA\6409132.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VEEKTIRQ\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\JXISYF5P\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf","","Neural networks; Wave propagation; Numerical modelling; Seismic anisotropy; fuzzy logic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep-learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are nonsmooth and describe structurally complex media. Thus, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field (Lippmann-Schwinger) wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove the source singularity. We first illustrate that nonsmooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function to better couple the real and imaginary parts of the wavefield. Moreover, we design new neurons by replacing the classical affine function with a quadratic function in the argument of the activation function to better capture the nonsmooth features of the wavefields. We find that the PML condition and the quadratic functions improve the results including handling attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained to predict a wavefield for a specific medium can be used as an initial model of the neural network for predicting other wavefields corresponding to PDE-coefficient alterations and improving the convergence speed accordingly. This pretraining strategy should find applications in iterative full-waveform inversion and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments is small. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Comparing activation functions in solving the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks","","","","","","Solving the wave equation numerically constitutes the majority of the computational cost for applications like seismic imaging and full-waveform inversion (FWI). One approach is to solve the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation which allows a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like FWI. Therefore, recently an approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenges associated with the conventional algorithms. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed, especially in the presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function, which we find to yield superior performance compared to the rest. © (2021) by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)All rights reserved.","2021","2024-08-24 17:34:24","2024-08-28 21:32:45","","5438-5442","","","7","","","IS IT TIME TO SWISH?","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","80 - No","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VFYIDBVV\Al Safwan et al. - 2021 - Is it time to swish Comparing activation function.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NWSJ4DQX\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","82nd EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method.

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two synthetic datasets and a field dataset.","2024-03-26","2024-09-04 19:44:37","2024-11-27 16:05:02","2024-09-04 19:44:37","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Cited by - 0 - Preprint - 10 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GRELKJQF\Alfarhan et al. - 2024 - Robust Full Waveform Inversion with deep Hessian d.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\HAASCAUN\2403.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2403.17518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly problematic for full waveform inversion, which typically involves numerous runs of the forward process. In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer.

This is exacerbated by the fact that new simulations must be performed when-ever the velocity structure or source location is perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called neural operator. A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method’s applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure.

However, stability is a prominent concern due to the exponential increase in high-frequency ambient noise during seismic wavefield propagation. The two primary strategies for mitigating instability in Q-RTM are regularization and low-pass filtering. Q-RTM instability can be addressed through regularization. However, determining the appropriate regularization parameters is often an experimental process, leading to challenges in accurately recovering the wavefield. Another approach to control instability is low-pass filtering. Nevertheless, selecting the cutoff frequency for different Q values is a complex task. In situations with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in seismic data, using low-pass filtering can make Q-RTM highly unstable. The need for a small cutoff frequency for stability can result in a significant loss of high-frequency signals. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that leverages data-driven concepts to address the issue of amplitude attenuation in seismic records, particularly when dealing with instability during the Q-RTM (reverse time migration with Q-attenuation) process. Our innovative framework is executed using a convolutional neural network. This network has the capability to both predict and compensate for the missing high-frequency components caused by Q-effects while simultaneously reconstructing the low-frequency information present in seismograms. This approach helps mitigate overwhelming instability phenomena and enhances the overall generalization capacity of the model. Numerical examples demonstrate that our Q-RTM results closely align with the reference images, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed MTL frequency-extension method. This method effectively compensates for the attenuation of high-frequency signals and mitigates the instability issues associated with the traditional Q-RTM process. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-08-24 17:44:09","2024-11-27 16:00:55","","","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 2 - 93 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\52CUKUWF\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\S37IIZR9\Xue et al. - 2023 - A Multi-Task Learning Framework of Stable Q-Compen.pdf","","","deep learning; fractional wave equation; Q-RTM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This modeling is based upon a wave equation and it depends on a set of parameters of the subsurface. Recent studies have demonstrated that deep learning methods can be trained with seismic data to estimate velocity models that give a representation of the subsurface where the seismic data was generated. Thus, an analysis is made on the impact that different sets of parameters have on the estimation of velocity models by a fully convolutional network (FCN). The experiments varied the number of sources among four options (1, 10, 25 or 50 shots) and used three different ranges of peak frequencies: 4, 8 and 16 Hz. The results demonstrated that, although the number of sources have more influence on the computational time needed to train the FCN than the peak frequency, both changes have significant impact on the quality of the estimation. The best estimations were obtained with the experiment of 25 sources with 4 Hz and increasing the peak frequency to 8 Hz improved even more the results, especially regarding the FCN's loss function. © 2019 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.","2019","2024-08-24 17:43:28","2024-11-27 15:53:33","","93-98","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 0 - 92 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\IXSPFKK9\Campos et al. - 2019 - An empirical analysis of the influence of seismic .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\33PPBUTQ\display.html","","","Deep Learning; Fully Convolutional Networks; Geophysics; Seismic Data Analysis; Velocity Model Estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WMSCI 2019 - 23rd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied an automatic workflow to continuous data from 43 seismic stations in Puerto Rico to build an enhanced earthquake catalog with ∼180,000 events for the 3+ yr sequence from 28 December 2019 to 1 January 2023. This workflow contained the EQTransformer (EQT) deep learning model for event detection and phase picking, the EikoNet-Hypocenter Inversion with Stein Variational Inference probabilistic earthquake location approach with a neural network trained to solve the eikonal wave equation, and relocation with event-pair waveform cross correlation. EQT increased the number of catalog events in the sequence by about seven times, though its performance was not quite as good as thorough analyst review. The enhanced catalog revealed new structural details of the sequence space–time evolution, including sudden changes in activity, on a complex system of many small normal and strike-slip faults. This sequence started on 28 December 2019 with an M 4.7 strike-slip earthquake followed by 10 days of shallow strike-slip foreshocks, including several M 5+ earthquakes, in a compact region. The oblique normal fault Mw 6.4 mainshock then hap-pened on 7 January 2020. Early aftershocks in January 2020, with several M 5+ earthquakes, quickly expanded into two intersecting fault zones with diffuse seismicity: one extending ∼ 35 km on a northward-dipping normal fault and the other ∼60-km-long and oriented west-northwest–east-southeast on strike-slip faults. Months to years later, aftershocks moved westward, deeper, and to outer reaches of the active fault zones, with abrupt rapid seismicity migration following larger M 4.7+ aftershocks in May, July, and December 2020. The observed seismicity evolution indicates cascading failure from stress transfer on multiple critically stressed faults. High aftershock productivity results from the complex multiple-fault network hosting the sequence, which is characteristic of an immature fault system in the diffuse deformation zone around Puerto Rico, at the complicated North American– Caribbean plate boundary region. © Seismological Society of America.","2023","2024-08-24 17:41:29","2024-11-27 15:52:50","","2377-2415","","6","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 10 - 90 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\HA9EUC24\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\DMKY9W86\Yoon et al. - 2023 - A Detailed View of the 2020–2023 Southwestern Puer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Full waveform inversion seeks to match observed seismic data with synthesized seismograms by iteratively updating subsurface model parameters. Synthetic data are generated by solving the seismic wave equation using an effective and efficient numerical algorithm. In order to ensure inversion accuracy and stability, both synthesized and observed seismograms must be carefully pre-processed. More specifically, when synthetic and observed data have a large waveform mismatch during the initial iterations, waveforms should be carefully selected for calculating the misfit gradient in order to avoid instability. We introduce a fully automated algorithm based on machine learning (ML) to intelligently select time windows for calculating the misfit between observed and synthetic seismograms.

Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep-learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian processes to invert microseismic events. For fairness of comparison, we train our emulators on the same microseismic traces and using the same geophysical setting. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions, g1/4g€¯100 times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian processes, and a O(105) speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2g€¯s long synthetic trace can be generated in g1/4g€¯10 ms on a common laptop processor, instead of g1/4g€¯1g€¯h using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile graphics processing unit card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy, and scalability of our open-source deep-learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms. © Copyright:","2021","2024-08-24 17:40:07","2024-11-27 15:52:19","","1683-1705","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 9 - 87 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BVHFBUX5\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\DXANI2WI\Spurio Mancini et al. - 2021 - Accelerating Bayesian microseismic event location .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images. We show by numerical experimentation that the surrogate model can reproduce the seismic images accurately, and, more importantly, the uncertainty propagation from the input velocity fields to the image ensemble. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2021","2024-08-24 17:39:18","2024-11-27 15:51:51","","1229-1250","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 5 - 86 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BZ28ARM5\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3LPP73LC\Freitas et al. - 2021 - An encoder-decoder deep surrogate for reverse time.pdf","","","Deep learning; Reverse time migration; Surrogate modeling; Uncertainty quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, conventional FWI with a least-squares loss function suffers from various drawbacks, such as the local-minima problem and human intervention in the fine-tuning of parameters. It is particular problematic when applied with noisy data and inadequate starting models. Recent work relying on partial differential equations and neural networks show promising performance in two-dimensional FWI. Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we propose an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates the wave equation with a discriminative network to accurately estimate physically consistent velocity models in a distributional sense (FWIGAN). The introduced framework does not require a labeled training dataset or pretraining of the network; therefore, this framework is flexible and able to achieve inversion with minimal user interaction. We experimentally validate our method for three baseline geological models, and a comparison of the results demonstrates that FWIGAN faithfully recovers the velocity models and consistently outperforms other traditional or deep learning-based algorithms. A further benefit from the physics-constrained learning used in this method is that FWIGAN mitigates the local-minima issue by reducing the sensitivity to initial models or data noise. © 2023.

This process is fully automatic with high stability and is not very sensitive to data quality. In this article, we propose an elastic WT inversion algorithm based on the AE method (AEWT) to invert the P -velocity model.

In the proposed framework, two feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked with reconstructing the seismic data, whereas an auxiliary, smaller network estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (coarsely sampled) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and precomputed local slopes. We find that introducing a second network to estimate the local slopes, whereas at the same time interpolating the aliased data enhances the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the primary network. Moreover, an additional positional encoding layer embedded as the first layer of the wavefield network confers to the network the ability to converge faster, improving the accuracy of the data term. © 2024 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

To simplify the model building problem, we develop a supervised end-to-end conventional neural network to reconstruct the P-wave velocity models directly from raw seismic data. The network takes in one-shot seismic traces simulated with acoustic wave equations in VSP geometry. To train the network, we create 750 2D synthetic seismic images and corresponding labeled images, which are shown to be sufficient for the network to learn the nonlinear relationship between one-shot seismic data and the corresponding velocity model.

Two-step dispersion inversion schema is the dominant method used to invert the surface wave data generated by the cross-correlation of ambient noise signals. However, the two-step methods have a 1-D layered model assumption, which does not account for the complex wave propagation. To overcome this limitation, we employ a 2-D wave-equation dispersion (WD) inversion method which reconstructs the subsurface shear (S) velocity model in one step, and elastic wave-equation modeling is used to simulate the subsurface wave propagation. In the WD method, the optimal S velocity model is obtained by minimizing the dispersion curve differences between the observed and predicted surface wave data, which makes WD method less prone to getting stuck to local minima. In our study, the observed Scholte waves are generated by cross-correlating continuous ambient noise signals recorded by each ocean bottom node (OBN) in the 3-D Gorgon OBN survey, Western Australia. For every two OBN lines, the WD method is used to retrieve the 2-D S velocity structure beneath the first line. We then use a robust neural network (NN)-based method to interpolate the inverted 2-D velocity slices to a continuous 3-D velocity model and also generate a corresponding uncertainty model. Moreover, we compared the predicted dispersion curves and waveforms to the observed data, and a robust waveform and dispersion match are observed across all of the Gorgon OBN lines. © 2022 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.","2022","2024-08-24 17:12:44","2024-11-27 15:48:40","","","","12","127","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 0 - 61 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\LHS2L83A\Chen y Saygin - 2022 - 3-D S Wave Imaging via Robust Neural Network Inter.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\S9L2NMJK\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drill-string dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks while drilling. By exploiting the derived models’ particular structure, we combine the drill-string dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks’ intrinsic energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis. The different approaches are tested and validated in simulations. We discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

We propose a two-stage unsupervised machine-learning (ML) methodology for efficient and accurate seismic impedance inversion. The first stage utilizes the generalization capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to produce realistic estimates of the acoustic impedance (AI), whereas the second stage incorporates physics information to generate synthetic data from the subsurface AI distribution.

Elastic FWI inverts multicomponent data for P and S-wave velocities and densities. We propose an alternative approach for FWI using a combination of machine learning and the physics of wave propagation. Unlike a conventional supervised machine learning, we do not require known answers to train our network. The multicomponent shot gathers are input to a convolutional neural network (CNNs) based auto encoder whose outputs are used as P-wave, S-wave and density models that are used to compute synthetic seismograms using the stress-velocity formulation of the elastic wave equation. The synthetic data are compared against observed input data and the misfit is estimated. The gradient of the misfit with respect to the velocity model parameters is calculated using the adjoint state method. The adjoint state gradient is then used to update the network weights using the automatic differentiation technique. Once the misfit term converges, the neural network can generate subsurface models consistent with the observed data. We observe that the neural network can capture spatial correlations at different scales and thus can introduce regularization in our inverse problem.

Therefore, the seismic inversion problem based on partial differential wave equations can be addressed using automatic differentiation in the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks, eliminating the need for explicit backpropagating the residual wavefield. However, one challenge that arises in the context of automatic differentiation is the significant memory usage due to the necessity of storing the hidden states of the RNN (i.e., wavefields in seismic modeling) during forward computation for constructing the computational graph and computing the derivatives during backpropagation. This memory overhead can become a bottleneck, particularly when dealing with large-scale inversion problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose an effective boundary-saving strategy that allows for the reconstruction of the computational graph during the backpropagation process. Instead of storing all the intermediate wavefields at each time step, we selectively save the necessary information at the boundaries, thereby significantly reducing the memory footprint. This approach enables us to maintain the convenience and efficiency of automatic differentiation computations while minimizing the memory requirements. Both 2-D and 3-D numerical experiments validate the accurate reconstruction of wavefields with minimal loss in precision, while the computational graph is simultaneously reconstructed.

However, due to the limited wavefield propagation angle, it is difficult to use one-way wave equation-based migration for high-precision imaging of structures with large inclinations due to issues such as inaccurate amplitudes and migration image artifacts. In addition, when the model has large horizontal velocity differences, it is difficult for the one-way wave propagator to calculate an accurate wavefield phase. Reverse time migration (RTM) based on the two-way wave propagator has a high resolution and avoids the issues associated with one-way wave propagators; however, it has a high computational cost in practical applications. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) application mode that improves one migration method by learning from another one and design a CNN with a structure similar to U-net that combines the advantages of both migration methods. The CNN label is the RTM result, and the corresponding input is the result of one-way wave migration with a generalized screen propagator (GSP). The trained CNN model improves the amplitude in the one-way wave migration image and removes the errors caused by large lateral velocity perturbations. Moreover, by maintaining the high migration calculation efficiency, our CNN model allows for a high resolution, few artifacts, and accurate images of steep structures in the one-way wave migration result. With our method, the accuracy of the one-way wave migration result is close to that of the RTM result.

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-08-24 16:01:33","2024-11-27 15:45:02","","","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 2 - 29 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NU93K4BT\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\42JME73W\Lu y Zhang - 2023 - Seismic Velocity Inversion via Physical Embedding .pdf","","","seismic waveform inversion; causal sequence; physical information neural network; velocity modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address such issues, physics informed machine learning methods have been developed which can integrate the governing physics law into the learning process. In this work, a 1-dimensional (1D) time-dependent seismic wave equation is considered and solved using two methods, namely Gaussian process (GP) and physics informed neural networks.

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost. © 2013 IEEE.","2020","2024-08-24 15:57:16","2024-11-27 15:43:59","","112266-112277","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 50 - 24 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KEK5JVDB\Ren et al. - 2020 - A Physics-Based Neural-Network Way to Perform Seis.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\AHE5YR5I\display.html","","","Acoustic wavefield modeling; deep learning inversion; seismic waveform inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a sequence of fast seismic acquisition for dispersion curve extraction and inversion for 3D seismic models, based on wavefield gradiometry, wave equation inversion, and machine-learning technology. The seismic array method that we use is Helmholtz wave equation inversion using measured wavefield gradients, and the dispersion curve inversions are based on a mixture of density neural networks (NNs). For our approach, we assume that a single surface wave mode dominates the data. We derive a nonlinear relationship among the unknown true seismic wave velocities, the measured seismic wave velocities, the interstation spacing, and the noise level in the signal. First with synthetic and then with the field data, we find that this relationship can be solved for unknown true seismic wave velocities using fixed point iterations. To estimate the noise level in the data, we need to assume that the effect of noise varies weakly with the frequency and we need to be able to calibrate the retrieved average dispersion curves with an alternate method (e.g., frequency wavenumber analysis). The method is otherwise self-contained and produces phase velocity estimates with tens of minutes of noise recordings. We use NNs, specifically a mixture density network, to approximate the nonlinear mapping between dispersion curves and their underlying 1D velocity profiles. The networks turn the retrieved dispersion model into a 3D seismic velocity model in a matter of seconds. This opens the prospect of near-real-time near-surface seismic velocity estimation using dense (and potentially rolling) arrays and only ambient seismic energy. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","2020","2024-08-24 00:08:49","2024-11-27 15:43:08","","KS13-KS27","","1","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 25 - 22 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XX8JM5HB\Cao et al. - 2020 - Near-real-time near-surface 3D seismic velocity an.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VY8L9JMA\display.html","","","neural networks; high resolution; near surface; surface wave; survey design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Training data for deep neural networks is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on data generated by the FGA, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three-layered model, a sine interface, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks are trained by both clean and noisy data.","2020-05-15","2024-08-24 00:06:10","2024-11-27 15:33:52","2024-08-24 00:06:10","109313","","","409","","Journal of Computational Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","Cited by - 4 - 20 - Yes - Inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\598L9GYT\S0021999120300875.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\D5JHRV7E\Hateley et al. - 2020 - Deep learning seismic substructure detection using.pdf","","","Image segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Elastic wave equation; Frozen Gaussian approximation; High-frequency wavefield; Seismic tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when multiple parameters are updated simultaneously, the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters will be coupled together, the effect exacerbate the nonlinear problem. We propose a parametric EFWI method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN-EFWI). The parameters that need to be updated are the weights in the neural network rather than the elastic models. The convolutional kernel in the network can increase spatial correlations of elastic models, which can be regard as a regularization strategy to mitigate local minima issue. Furthermore, the representation also can mitigate the cross-talk between parameters due to the reconstruction of Frechét derivatives by neural networks. Both forward and backward processes are implemented using a time-domain finite-difference solver for elastic wave equation. Numerical examples on overthrust models, fluid saturated models and 2004 BP salt body models demonstrate that CNN-EFWI can partially mitigate the local minima problem and reduce the dependence of inversion on the initial models. Mini-batch configuration is used to speed up the update and achieve fast convergence.

However, conventional rock physics models (RPMs), e.g., the Xu-White model, struggle to accurately obtain the key parameters such as pore aspect ratio in the process of S-wave velocity prediction. This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorporating the decoupled Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is sufficient.

If seismic data lack low frequencies, their resolution deteriorates, leading to inaccurate seismic interpretations. To resolve this problem, we developed a low-frequency reconstruction that employs a modified U-Net neural network. To improve the training of the neural network, we generated training data analogous to unseen data, based on the far-field signature as the wavelet source to retain the spectral characteristics of field data. We addressed potential overfitting by generating a large amount of various synthetic data through wave equation-based modelling using a variety of velocity and density models. After synthesising the seismic data, we implemented a filtering method to produce input data with insufficient low frequencies and label data with sufficient low frequencies. The far-field signature plays an important role in the successful reconstruction of low frequencies due to its intrinsic field data features and greater low-frequency information compared to field data alone. We tested the generalisation of the network using unseen synthetic and field data not used in the training stage, and analyzed the results in the time and frequency domains. Although the input data did not retain frequencies below 10 Hz, the trained network predicted low frequencies that were similar to the desired data. We also produced post-stack sections via simple processing to evaluate low-frequency reconstructions produced by our trained network.

Traditional model-driven full-waveform inversion (FWI) methods, which rely on an initial velocity, suffer from low computational efficiency. Conversely, data-driven deep-learning (DL) approaches heavily rely on extensive training data and lack interpretability due to overreliance on training data for generalization. To address these challenges, we present a seismic velocity inversion network model that incorporates prior knowledge and constraints based on physical laws. The proposed approach involves constructing a data-driven inversion network with dual encoders and single decoder structure, enabling the learning of nonlinear mappings from seismic data to velocity models. By incorporating prior well-logging data and attention mechanisms, the inversion process is improved. In addition, a seismic forward modeling network based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is developed to solve the acoustic wave equation. Leveraging the advantages of parallel computing, the forward modeling process achieves fast calculations. The automatic differentiation algorithm in DL facilitates gradient calculations, specifically back propagation of the residuals to incorporate the physical constraints. Ultimately, the proposed seismic velocity inversion network combines the two network structures while incorporating the constraint of wave field extrapolation law.

However, it requires a great amount of computational resources, which becomes prohibitive when both the modeling domain size and the number of the time samples increase. Therefore, much research has been performed to enhance the computational efficiency of seismic numerical modeling. The expanding domain method is such one technique that improves the computational efficiency by identifying the domain extent where the wave propagation has not reached and excluding these domains from the calculation. In this work, we propose a new deep-learning based method that guide the determination of the computational domain. In order to establish the computational domain where the wave propagates from the snapshots, the deep learning-based object detection was employed. The deep learning object detector used has two main components. The first one is a structure for the feature extraction layers based on ResNet-50.

However, their application is limited by high computational costs and existing surrogate models lack the flexibility of numerical solvers. This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.","2024-04-15","2024-09-04 19:54:39","2024-11-26 21:51:08","2024-09-04 19:54:39","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Cited by - 0 - Preprint - 22 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XWEX83JI\Lehmann et al. - 2024 - Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GHCNY9GA\2404.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2404.10115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, obtaining such solutions in media characterized by strong parameter contrasts and anisotropy poses significant practical challenges to existing numerical solvers, especially for 3D scenarios. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) provide a computationally efficient alternative approach for AWE solutions. However, PINNs solve only a single instance of AWE and need to be re-trained for each different subsurface models and frequencies. Fourier neural operators, on the other hand, can solve AWE for a wide range of models and frequencies with a single set of network configuration and parameters. This method, though, requires a tremendous amount of data, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a methodology that combines PINNs with Fourier neural operators to learn AWE solution operators that are valid for a wide range of frequencies without requiring any training data. We present two numerical examples that demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method in modeling the acoustic wavefield accurately and efficiently in the frequency domain.","2021-10-18","2024-07-24 21:59:58","2024-11-26 21:49:31","2024-07-24 21:59:58","1-5","","","2021","","","","","","","","European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers","","en","","","","","www.earthdoc.org","","Cited by - 13 - 64 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G8VD8V46\Konuk y Shragge - 2021 - Physics-guided deep learning using Fourier neural .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\YBS6VLLX\2214-4609.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","82nd EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thousands of such forward simulations are often a routine requirement for parameter estimation of microseimsic events via a suitable source inversion process. Parameter estimation based on forward modelling is often advantageous over a direct regression-based inversion approach when there are unknown number of parameters to be estimated and the seismic data have complicated noise characteristics which may not always allow a stable and unique solution in a direct inversion process. In this paper, starting from Graphics Processing Unit based synthetic simulations of a few thousand forward seismic shots due to microseismic events via pseudo-spectral solution of elastic wave equation, we develop a step-by-step process to generate a surrogate regression modelling framework, using machine learning techniques that can produce accurate seismograms at specified receiver locations. The trained surrogate models can then be used as a high-speed meta-model/emulator or proxy for the original full elastic wave propagator to generate seismic responses for other microseismic event locations also. The accuracies of the surrogate models have been evaluated using two independent sets of training and testing Latin hypercube quasi-random samples, drawn from a heterogeneous marine velocity model. The predicted seismograms have been used thereafter to calculate batch likelihood functions, with specified noise characteristics. Finally, the trained models on 23 receivers placed at the sea-bed in a marine velocity model are used to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the event locations which can in future be used in a Bayesian analysis for microseismic event detection. © The Author(s) 2018.","2018","2024-08-24 17:27:17","2024-11-26 21:49:08","","1257-1290","","2","215","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Cited by - 15 - 76 - Yes - Forward","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\2H72UXL7\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\W7ZK9TN4\Das et al. - 2018 - Surrogate regression modelling for fast seismogram.pdf","","computational seismology","Joint inversion; Seismic noise; Statistical methods; Statistical seismology; Time-series analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total cost strictly depends on the number of frequency components that are considered, if using a finite-difference method. For the applications such as seismic imaging and inversion, high-frequency information is always required and thus the wave simulation is always a challenging task as it demands tremendous computational cost for obtaining dispersion-free high-frequency wavefields for large subsurface models. This paper demonstrates that a data-driven machine learning method, called the Fourier neural operator (FNO), is capable of predicting high-frequency wavefields, based on a limited number of low-frequency components.

Moreover, DL handles three kinds of noise simultaneously instead of sequentially. The DL method achieves satisfying denoising quality with no requirements of (i) accurate modeling of the signal and noise; (ii) optimal parameters tuning. We call it intelligent denoising.

These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state-of-the-art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges.
